<div class="text">
<p>At first, <cite class="Comics">Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again</cite> reminded me of <cite class="Movies">Gigli</cite>. No, seriously. <cite>Gigli</cite> is a movie in which some parts are good, other parts are good but you find yourself asking &#8220;Why the hell&#8217;s that in <em>this</em> movie?&#8221; and other parts make you hope they&#8217;re an absurdist parody but you have this horrible feeling the director actually wants us to watch that final scene with the mentally retarded kid whose only dream in life is to meet the hot babes of <cite class="Television">Baywatch</cite> and find it <em>touching</em> and <em>heartwarming</em>&#8230;</p>
<p>So <cite>DK2</cite> was like that, except mostly scenes in the latter two categories.</p>
<p>Now I think that&#8217;s probably much the effect <cite class="People">Frank Miller</cite> and <cite class="People">Lynn Varley</cite> were going for. (Miller and Varley are both listed on the front cover, and <cite class="People">Todd Klein</cite> is listed just below them on the title page, no information about what each actually did on the book, which I think is neat because the message seems to be &#8220;We are all equally authors of this text&#8221; but I suppose it would be annoying if you didn&#8217;t already know who each author was and which parts of the text he or she contributed. At any rate, hereafter I&#8217;m going to go auteur and refer to the &#8220;author&#8221; as &#8220;Miller&#8221; and &#8220;he.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Something just occured to me: the plot, such as it is, of <cite>DK2</cite> involves Lex Luthor and Brainiac faking an alien invasion to maintain their control of the populace (and to kill off the pesky superheroes). Sound familiar&#8230;? Yeah, <cite class="Comics">Watchmen</cite>! An allusion? I think so. And <cite>DK2</cite> pretends to be a sequel to <cite>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</cite>, but it really doesn&#8217;t work as a sequel&#8212;it&#8217;s more of an extended allusion ot <cite>DKR</cite>.</p>
<p>How would you feel if you fancied yourself something of an iconoclast in the realm of superhero comics, somebody who&#8217;s not so worried about preserving traditions, who in fact likes to kick tradition in the ass and go looking for fun new stuff&#8230; and you found that people have <em>canonized</em> a comic you created 15 years ago? You&#8217;d feel a lot like Frank Miller must have when he decided to write <cite>DK2</cite>, I bet. Miller doesn&#8217;t strike me as the sort who likes his books to be safe. But <cite>DKR</cite> is second only to <cite>Watchmen</cite> in safeness&#8212;not that either of these books is safe or comfortable if you read them and pay attention, but they&#8217;re safe in that they have such a status among comics readers that they&#8217;re practically untouchable and most negative criticism is met with indifference at best, even though many readers would probably be hard pressed to explain just why they&#8217;re so great without resorting to mumbling about &#8220;deconstruction&#8221; and other fancy words they probably can&#8217;t define. They&#8217;re respectable comics.</p>
<p>Canons and classics are just fine, no doubt about it, but if you revere the canon at the cost of ignoring other good new comics, comics will stagnate. How many times have you heard somebody say &#8220;There has never been a comic since <cite>Watchmen</cite> that was as good as <cite>Watchmen</cite>&#8221; or &#8220;<cite>Watchmen</cite> is the best comic ever written&#8221;? I&#8217;ve seen lots of people say things like that, and it&#8217;s bullshit. There have been piles and piles of superhero comics as good as or better than <cite>Watchmen</cite> and <cite>DKR</cite>. Miller doesn&#8217;t want to be safe and respectable, he wants to kick tradition in the ass and blow up icons. <cite>DK2</cite> is his powerful projectile aimed directly at the reputation of <cite>DKR</cite>. The projectile is&#8230; Superman and Wonder Woman, united in carnal embrace.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t read <cite>DK2</cite>, trust me, you have to read the Wonder Woman-Superman sex scene yourself to grasp its full impact. Superman has just been beaten up by Batman, blown up by the Flash, shot full of Kryptonite by Green Arrow, and had the Atom inserted directly into his brain: he&#8217;s in bad shape. Wonder Woman finds him at the site of the erstwhile Fortress of Solitude and berates him, saying among other things, &#8220;Where is the hero who threw me to the ground and took me as his rightful prize?&#8221; Yes, Wonder Woman, doing a Red Sonja act! Then she and Superman fuck each other&#8217;s brains out so hard that, I&#8217;m not kidding folks, they cause catastrophic seismic and weather disruptions across the entire world. If your reaction as you read this passage (pp. 111-124 of the trade paperback collection) isn&#8217;t something like &#8220;What the <em>fuck</em>???&#8221; then you are entirely too jaded for your own good. And that&#8217;s exactly the reaction Miller&#8217;s going for. Whether you think it&#8217;s good reading hardly matters (I do not think it is good reading, I think it scarred my poor innocent brain for all eternity). What matters is that Miller has broken free of the limited bounds within which Superman and Wonder Woman had been allowed to operate. <cite>DK2</cite> has many other more, dare I say it, subtle ways of breaking free, like giving Superman and Wonder Woman a daughter (who, in one of the book&#8217;s best scenes, demands that Superman tell her about Kryptonian sex).</p>
<p>If I haven&#8217;t made it clear, I had a lot of fun with <cite>DK2</cite>, although to a certain extent it&#8217;s not a book that was designed to be liked (at least, not liked by everybody). The fact that so many people hate it is arguably a sign of success&#8212;I suspect Miller deliberately wrote a book he knew a lot of people would hate, not just to screw with his fans but as proof against it&#8217;s ever losing its edge and becoming safe and comfortable.

<div class="text">
<p>I&#8217;m home sick from work today but, as my dad always says, too sick to enjoy it, alas. I&#8217;m assuming it&#8217;s a mild flu (complete with <a href="http://politedissent.com/archives/27/">respiratory symptoms</a>!) but it&#8217;s annoying. This is all a prelude to ranting, letting you know there&#8217;s a mild chance when I come to my senses I&#8217;ll think everything I&#8217;m saying is insane. But onward!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about <cite class="People">Barb Lien-Cooper</cite>&#8217;s opinion piece &#8220;<a href="http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/pb/108394270256716.htm">Why Don&#8217;t Chicks Dig Comics? Well, Why Don&#8217;t You ASK One?</a>&#8221; and several things about it have been nagging at me.</p>
<p>First, and maybe most importantly, there&#8217;s this:</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition, in spite of the fact that women are made to feel somewhat more welcome in comic book stores, there&#8217;s still a slight majority of stores that WANT to be like Floyd&#8217;s Barbershop or whatever. Some places REVEL in being the last place on earth a man can hang out without having to deal with women or their objections to how women are treated as customers, as readers, as creators, and as characters in comics. I&#8217;ve been to some stores where I have been made to feel unwelcome because of my gender. Those experiences were like accidentally stepping into a men&#8217;s locker room.</p></blockquote>
<p>Relatedly, <cite class="People">Alex de Campi</cite>  said that <a href="http://www.ninthart.com/display.php?article=840">German comics stores are more girl-friendly</a>. I have no way of knowing whether the German part is true. I didn&#8217;t find any specialty comics shops in Turkey, and I suppose the Spanish stores I was in would have been friendly to girls who liked Conan and porn. But I&#8217;m bothered by the constant references to offensive behaviors in stores. I&#8217;ve never had any myself, but I stand up for myself. The problem is that if these kinds of things are going on, <strong>we need to know details</strong>. If there are stores with systematic discrimination towards women or where there&#8217;s a hostile shopping environment, there needs to be a list of names all over the internet so the managers can explain themselves and improve and be aware that this is a problem, and so that the rest of us who care about this issue can choose to shop accordingly. It seems like the most basic site for comics activism, and yet I&#8217;ve never seen anything beyond such vague complaints.</p>
<p>But then there&#8217;s the whole issue of why women <em>need</em> to be reading comics anyway. I&#8217;ve participated in lots of male-dominated fields and never considered that much of a problem or a barrier, nor did it deter me from following things that interested me. I&#8217;m also a knitter, a stereotypically female activity, and in reading message boards and knitting blogs there are plenty of entreaties to remember that men knit too and not to assume that all knitters are women as well as comments to the pattern makers that they should include more clothing for men, but I haven&#8217;t seen much widespread activism to get men as a group more involved in knitting. So why do comics readers get hung up on this kind of Affirmative Action, tricks to get women to read comics? As Barb points out, lots of women do read comics, especially manga. So where exactly is the problem?</p>
<p>I have yet to meet a comics reader who&#8217;s really just happy with the status quo. Whether it&#8217;s wanting writers to conform more closely to their view of the Platonic form of Green Arrow or wanting new writers (or a return of old writers) or different art styles or more or less editorial involvement, comics fans all want to make comics <em>better</em>. So when the thesis of such gender-driven articles invariably is that comics should be written better with more awareness of interpersonal interaction and characterization, why is this in any way special to women? To me, that feels patronizing; it&#8217;s not enough to say &#8220;Smart, sensible people want comics that read well and make sense,&#8221; but you have to add, &#8220;and chicks would dig it too!&#8221; I guess what I&#8217;m saying is that &#8220;what women want in comics&#8221; always turns out to be about what the <em>writer</em> wants in comics, which makes sense, but might be more useful if given in a more direct manner. The Class of Women is not a good demographic. Barb wisely suggests aiming for women who are already geeks, which I think is one place where comics have made significant inroads among female readers &#8211; or at least comics published by Vertigo and Slave Labor Graphics, as well as the aforementioned manga.</p>
<p>And one more gripe:</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now, we are a hermetically sealed off order from the mainstream, with more terms of art, jargon, rituals, secret symbols, inside jokes, and offshoots than one can shake a stick at. We&#8217;re the bloody Masons of subcultures! And, that&#8217;s the way a lot of us like it. We make it difficult for newbies to come inside, as we make it so only those who are willing to study the subculture and take its ways to heart feel welcome.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s true. Certainly superhero continuity seems like a ridiculous mess to an uninterested outsider, but that&#8217;s not all of &#8220;comics.&#8221; And I think what&#8217;s just been described is true of just about any self-selecting hobby group. There&#8217;s a new language you have to learn to be a part of any subculture, and having gone through several, I strongly disagree that it&#8217;s harder to learn to speak comics than it is to get into any other subculture. I started reading comics 4 or 5 years ago and have figured out how to get by, and I have absolutely horrible visual skills: it can&#8217;t be <em>that</em> difficult. I&#8217;ve also seen many people who do welcome new or potential readers, both online and real-life folks in general, as well as organizations like <a href="http://www.sequentialtart.com/">Sequential Tart</a> and <a href="http://www.friends-lulu.org/">Friends of Lulu</a>, both of which are explicitly interested in helping women transition into The Comics Lifestyle, whatever that is.</p>
<p>None of this means that I don&#8217;t want more women reading comics! Most of my comics-reading friends offline have been women, and plenty of the online ones are, too. I just don&#8217;t look at myself as being somehow special or privileged for being a woman who (gasp!) reads comics, even the superhero kind! But trying to use women as an excuse to advocate the kind of comics you like is stupid and demeaning. In Barb&#8217;s defense, she&#8217;s not just talking. Her comic <a href="http://www.graphicsmash.com/series.php?name=gsg&#038;view=current"><cite class="Comics">Gun Street Girl</cite></a> was created to fill what she considered gaps in the range of comics currently available. And I agree wholeheartedly that sexist discourse among and from comics professionals and fans needs to stop. I&#8217;m just sick of reading about what women want instead of reading good comics, and the ones I consider good won&#8217;t be good for all women. I&#8217;m ok with that. In fact, I think it&#8217;s great. But at least Barb didn&#8217;t advocate beefcake. Ick!

<div class="text">
<p>Hey, I&#8217;m back! For now&#8230; I&#8217;ve been having lots of trouble connecting to the Internet lately (entirely the fault of the awful campus network I&#8217;m on, so there&#8217;s not much I can do about it except graduate and move someplace with a good network), and given that I am preparing to graduate in about two weeks, I&#8217;ll probably be a bit busy in the near future and so the no-blogging trend may continue. I have lots of stuff to write about, but no time and an uncooperative Internet connection.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://imdb.com/title/tt0378194/quotes"><p>Superman stands alone. Superman did not become Superman, Superman was born Superman. When Superman wakes up in the morning, he is Superman. His alter ego is Clark Kent. His outfit with the big red S is the blanket he was wrapped in as a baby when the Kents found him. Those are his clothes. What Kent wears, the glasses the business suit, that&#8217;s the costume. That&#8217;s the costume Superman wears to blend in with us. Clark Kent is how Superman views us. And what are the characteristics of Clark Kent? He&#8217;s weak, unsure of himself&#8230; he&#8217;s a coward. Clark Kent is Superman&#8217;s critique on the whole human race, sort of like Beatrix Kiddo and Mrs. Tommy Plumpton.</p></blockquote>
<p>This, of course, is Bill&#8217;s monologue on <cite class="Comics">Superman</cite> from <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill Vol. 2</cite> (which <cite class="People">Quentin Tarantino</cite> apparently &#8220;borrowed&#8221; from <cite class="People">Jules Feiffer</cite>&#8217;s book <cite class="Books">The Great Comic Book Heroes</cite>). This is the most obvious possible interpretation of Superman, and frankly I&#8217;m surprised at the number of people I&#8217;ve encountered who seem deeply impressed by this allegedly brilliant interpretation. What did you folks <em>think</em> Superman was about?</p>
<p>Actually, I disagree with Bill. Well, certainly he&#8217;s right that Clark Kent isn&#8217;t the real guy, he&#8217;s a character Superman made up so he doesn&#8217;t have to be Superman all the time. However! Superman isn&#8217;t the real guy either&#8230; <i>Superman</i> certainly isn&#8217;t his real name, his name is Kal-El. (Or Kal-L on the erstwhile Earth-2.) That&#8217;s his Kryptonian name&#8212;so is the Kryptonian Kal-El the real guy? But he was never really Kryptonian. Sure, in the pre-Crisis DC Universe (and Bill has us talking pre-Crisis here, the weakling coward Clark Kent is a pre-Crisis artifact), it seems like half the population of Krypton managed to escape, what with Supergirl, Krypto, the bottled city of Kandor, and whatever other obscure Kryptonians were lurking around&#8212;but even with all those Kryptonians around, Kal-El could at best get history lessons. He couldn&#8217;t ever be part of a living Kryptonian culture. And anyway he certainly didn&#8217;t grow up Kryptonian. He grew up American, but his extraterrestrial origin and his superpowers serve as constant reminders that he&#8217;s far from a natural citizen. Even his powers aren&#8217;t naturally Kryptonian. He&#8217;s an emigrant from a place which doesn&#8217;t exist and which he never knew, to a place from which his alien genetics always separate him.</p>
<p>Superman has plenty of alter egos, but no natural self. His only nature is alienation from nature. He is, in fact, <a href="http://notthebeastmaster.typepad.com/weblog/2004/04/metaphor_shmeta.html">a metonym</a> of human nature, which is alienation from nature. What Christians call Original Sin, alienation from God. What people are looking for when they give up the hectic bustle of modern life and join a commune or something. The immigrant embodies this alienation physically, and Superman takes immigration to the next level: not only is he from another <em>planet</em>, he&#8217;s from another planet that <em>blew up</em> and no longer exists. It&#8217;s like Genesis without the moral judgement and without Happy Heaven as a final reward after a life of struggling to get back to Eden. Superman&#8217;s only reward for the true selves he tries to cobble together out of the pieces he&#8217;s been left with is no more and no less than whatever self he manges to cobble together. His life as Superman, Clark Kent, Kal-El are the closest he&#8217;ll ever get to Heaven. (This is one reason I find attempts to make Superman a Christ figure amusing. Or bemusing. He descends from some idealized place and takes on the burden of humanity, right, but then he doesn&#8217;t have any Heaven to ascend to! He&#8217;s like the first half of a Christ figure, which just means he&#8217;s human.)</p>
<p>As long as I&#8217;m writing about Superman&#8217;s identities I should note that <a href="http://www.whiterose.org/howlingcurmudgeons/archives/005816.html"><cite class="People">Chris Maka</cite></a> and <a href="http://ringwood.blogspot.com/2004_05_02_ringwood_archive.html#108396014637912415"><cite class="People">Ken Lowery</cite></a> are also pondering superhero identities. Ken specifically offers some criticism of the Punisher&#8217;s own identity issues, which makes sense but don&#8217;t trust me, I&#8217;ve never read any <cite class="Comics">Punisher</cite> comics.

I&#8217;ve just finished <cite class="People">Michael Swanwick</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Books">In the Drift</cite>, which I briefly thought meant I was now caught up on Swanwick, but a quick search shows I&#8217;m wrong. And it&#8217;s a book from 1985 about a post-apocalyptic United States.</p>
<p>There was a time in my life when I was obsessed with such stories, though it was admittedly after 1985, which was the time when I was obsessed with Narnia to the point where I could recite full pages from memory. <cite>In the Drift</cite> explores East Coast civilization after Three Mile Island, or rather after an accident at Three Mile Island in which, unlike in our history, catastrophe wasn&#8217;t averted. I can&#8217;t recall other books in which the nuclear apocalypse is not weapons-related, which added intrigue here.</p>
<p>Postapocalyptic fiction as I know it had its heyday in the late 80s, and I hope to revisit some of the titles I remember well. A lot were geared toward young adults, or at least the ones I read. Young adult books seem to be set in the time of the crisis featuring teenaged protagonists trapped in a world they didn&#8217;t create, trying to make sense of love and horror, which is to say just normal young adult books. This could be a small sample size problem, though, because the only exceptions I can think of at the moment are <cite>In the Drift</cite> and <cite class="Books">A Canticle for Leibowitz</cite>, which I reread last month and which seemed much more profound when I was 12. Both have standard future-story problems with pop culture references. It&#8217;s 70+ years after Three Mile Island and a journalist&#8217;s heroes are Hemingway and Ernie Pyle? Or perhaps I&#8217;m just frustrated because I had to reread the chapter of <cite>3001</cite> today in which a space captain in the titular year has a <em>photograph</em> of early 1900s explorers and explains a whole bunch of nonsensical multicentury history that makes no sense in the order in which it is given. Think, authors, think!</p>
<p>At any rate, I plan to come back to this when I&#8217;m awake, and I&#8217;ll focus on the two books just mentioned as well as the excellent <cite class="Books">Brother in the Land</cite>, which has another title too, and the <cite class="Books">After the Bomb</cite> series and the <cite class="Books">Tomorrow When the War Began</cite> series, which I haven&#8217;t finished because they&#8217;re really well after my time, as well as the entire phenomenon that was Stamp Out Sheep Press. And more, if I think of them. </p>
<p>I realize I was a grim little girl to be so taken with these stories of destruction and fleeting beauty, but maybe that&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t get around to reading comics until adulthood. I don&#8217;t think I really understood the Cold War paranoia necessary to accept a lot of the stories as directly applicable to my life, but they were awfully meaningful to me nonetheless. I don&#8217;t know if there are books like this for my littlest brother and his classmates, born the first time our country was at war in Iraq. I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d think their threats were the same, but I didn&#8217;t care about the bombs and not having a clear Red Menace didn&#8217;t make the stories less powerful to me, especially because the moral was always that you have to be at least as worried about &#8220;our&#8221; guys as &#8220;theirs,&#8221; and most worried of all about yourself and what you love.

<p>Last night&#8217;s bedtime reading was &#8220;Sociolinguistic Attitudes and Issues in Contemporary Britain,&#8221; by <cite class="People">Paul Alceo</cite>, an essay in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0195064992/qid=1083631268/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/002-5831807-9968063?v=glance&#038;s=books&#038;n=507846"><cite class="Books">English in Its Social Contexts: Essays in Historical Sociolinguistics</cite></a>, which cost me a dollar at Half Price Books and has been well worth the investment. I was fascinated to come across something entirely new to me: </p>
<blockquote><p>Polari survives in only about 100 words, the remnant of what was probably once a fuller criminal argot derived in part from Lingua Franca, a Mediterranean pidgin. It is a vocabulary, rather than a full language, used by vagabonds and homosexuals in the theater and navy.</p></blockquote>
<p>In looking at <a href="http://www.homeusers.prestel.co.uk/cello/Polari.htm">word</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polari#Examples_of_Polari_words_which_have_entered_mainstream_English_use">lists</a> I realize I&#8217;ve read many of the words before, admittedly mostly concerning &#8220;homosexuals in the theater&#8221; rather than those in the navy or vagabonds of any sexual orientation. Still, while I&#8217;d known that subcultures, particularly persecuted or marginalized ones, have their own inflections and code words and circumlocutions (something I was rather obsessed with as a teen, in fact) I&#8217;d never thought of this as a separate language. It makes me wonder when and how current argots will be discussed and codified, from 1337sprach to stupid cyberknitters&#8217; acronyms to all the other sorts of shared shorthands that the internet and blogs in particular create and nourish. This is something I like to watch while reading message boards and blogs, and I should probably pay more attention and keep track, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever do real sociolinguistic commentary on it.</p>
<p>As for Polari, the definitive source seems to be <a href="http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/staff/paulb/polari/home.htm"><cite class="People">Paul Baker</cite></a>, who has written <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0415261805/qid=1083632327/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/002-5831807-9968063?v=glance&#038;s=books">a history</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0826459617/qid=1083632327/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-5831807-9968063?v=glance&#038;s=books">a dictionary</a> (still in print!) of Polari. I intend to hit the library.</p>

<div class="text">
<p>Before any substance, I apologize for yet more lack of <cite class="Comics">Animal Man</cite>, but it&#8217;s been a crazy week at work and home and I haven&#8217;t gotten around to rereading or getting my thoughts in order. Poor <cite class="People">Steven</cite> has very limited internet access now, so he&#8217;s not going to be posting either until that situation improves.</p>
<p>So instead of comics, I&#8217;ll quickly review the book I finished early in the week, sowing that I haven&#8217;t actually kept to my plan of just quickly reviewing all the books I read.  This was <cite class="People">Margaret Atwood</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Books">The Edible Woman</cite>, copyright 1969. The copy I have is a paperback from the thrift store, the cover a woman-shaped refrigerator in a dark kitchen with an overflowing sink. The worst thing about it, though, is the blurb on the back cover:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ever since her engagement, the strangest thing has been happening to Marian McAlpin: she can&#8217;t eat. First meat. Then eggs, vegetables, cake, pumpkin seeds &#8211; everything! Worse yet, she has the crazy feeling that she&#8217;s <em>being</em> eaten. She really ought to feel consumed with passion. But she just feels&#8230;consumed.</p></blockquote>
<p> That&#8217;s not really what the book&#8217;s about, but it&#8217;s an interesting story itself. I don&#8217;t know why they thought a feminist horror book would sell, although perhaps that is sort of what <cite>The Edible Woman</cite> is, if a strange and ambiguous one. It&#8217;s set during the sexual revolution, when nice single women of middle-class backgrounds want to have sex and enjoy themselves and still be considered respectable by the sort of people who don&#8217;t approve of such things. At least that&#8217;s Marian&#8217;s situation when she agrees to marry her dull but functional boyfriend, and then her life gets much more strange. She&#8217;s losing her identity, her willingness to say what she thinks or what she wants, but at the same time she&#8217;s beginning to arrange trysts with an enigmatic, cadaverous literature grad student. Food becomes a weapon, but she&#8217;s not sure how to wield it, not sure how her body will betray her next in refusing to accept various forms of nourishment. She doesn&#8217;t know what pleasures are the ones she wants and whether they&#8217;ll be pleasures if she takes them.</p>
<p>I read my first Atwood as a very young teenager, <cite class="Books">Surfacing</cite>. The writing was lovely, but I found the story incomprehensible. The only story element I liked was a segment in which an Anglophone character remembers being mocked at school for translating <em>vers libre</em> as &#8220;free worms.&#8221; A decade later I understand well how educated women make foolish choices that leave them furiously searching for a source for their own unhappiness, so <cite>The Edible Woman</cite> makes sense. And that&#8217;s what I think is going on. It doesn&#8217;t matter how great or awful Marian&#8217;s fiance is if having a fiance is making her turn into something she hates and doesn&#8217;t recognize. It&#8217;s not a horror story in which an evil man is the villain, but interaction with a corrupt and confusing society. It&#8217;s a story about a quest for autonomy and self-awareness, not exactly achievable goals. </p>
<p><cite>The Edible Woman</cite> lacks the poetry of later Atwood writings and its metaphors and trajectory are obvious even to the characters. And yet I liked it enough to stay up too late two nights reading it, though not enough to devour it in one. I still prefer <cite class="People">Marge Piercy</cite> for frothy feminist novels, but Marian made a compelling protagonist, especially because of her ambiguous and only somewhat self-conscious analyses of herself and her peers. I was especially interested in it as a historical document of a setting where women can retire upon marriage and where even when you can be mistaken for a prostitute while wearing a girdle. The frivolous male grad students are a fascinating group, too, and are smugly excited by how shocking topics like S&#038;M in Lewis Carroll are.  All in all, it&#8217;s a very quick read and in many ways a frustrating one, but I enjoyed it.

<p>Did I say I was going to <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/04/21/invisible-crisis/">write more about <cite class="Comics">The Invisibles</cite></a>? I may have lied about that&#8230; I&#8217;d like to reread the whole series before I get into it.</p>
<p><a href="http://ynot.motime.com"><cite class="People">David Fiore</cite>&#8217;s</a> latest topic is <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1082980729#265154"><cite class="People">Joseph Campbell</cite>&#8217;s nefarious influence on some branches of superhero criticism</a>, and further explanation of <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1083064573#265819">corporate superhero universes as postructuralist narratives</a>. Here&#8217;s my crazy theory for the day: <cite class="Comics">Crisis on Infinite Earths</cite> is <cite class="People">Marv Wolfman</cite> and <cite class="People">George P&eacute;rez</cite>&#8217;s attempt to mythologize the DC Universe. See David:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://ynot.motime.com/1083064573#265819"><p>Obviously, myths <i>are</i> the products of many minds&#8212;but myths <i>qua</i> myths certainly aren&#8217;t <i>perceived</i> that way. Mythology is a &#8220;homogenous&#8221; body of work, the structuralist&#8217;s dream come true&#8212;it is taken for granted that, given enough time, a rigorous exegete could tease THE meaning out of the canonical writings. </p></blockquote>
<p>And again:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://ynot.motime.com/1082980729#265154"><p>Joseph Campbell is the ultimate modernist&#8212;at <i>war</i> with the &#8220;superstructure&#8221;/&#8220;false consciousness&#8221;. There&#8217;s only <i>one</i> hero see? And there aren&#8217;t many archetypes, either. Just focus kids, that modernist light will see you through the haze of multiplicity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just replace &#8220;hero&#8221; with &#8220;universe,&#8221; and there you go. I don&#8217;t have a lot to add now <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/04/21/invisible-crisis/">beyond what I&#8217;ve already written</a>, except to note the connections. Of course, <cite>Crisis</cite> didn&#8217;t succeed in its goal of homogenizing the DC Universe even remotely, and it seems to have created the conditions in which <cite class="People">Mark Waid</cite> and <a href="http://grant-morrison.com/"><cite class="People">Grant Morrison</cite></a> were able to incorporate poststructuralism into the very textual fabric of the DC Universe with the introductoin of Hypertime. Just look at this, <a href="http://warrenellis.com/"><cite class="People">Warren Ellis</cite>&#8217;s</a> attempt to describe Morrison&#8217;s description of Hypertime, taken from the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/hypertime2000/index2.html">Unofficial Hypertime Website 5.0</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.geocities.com/hypertime2000/features/morrison.html"><p>Take a glass sphere studded all over with holes, and then drive a long stick right through the middle of it, passing exactly through the center of the volume. That&#8217;s the base DC timeline. Jab another stick through right next to it, but at a different angle, so that they&#8217;re touching at one point. That&#8217;s an Elseworlds story. Another stick, this one rippled, placed close in so that it touches the first stick at two or three points. That&#8217;s the base Marvel timeline. Perhaps others follow the line of the DC stick for a while before diverging, a slow diagonal collision along it before peeling off. This sphere contains the timeline of all comic-book realities, and they theoretically all have access to each other. In high time, at the top of the sphere, is OUR reality, and we can look down on the totality of Hypertime, the entire volume.</p>
<p>Hypertime is a tool for the consideration of fictional reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>The funny thing about <cite>Crisis</cite> is that it posits &#8220;trying to discover the orign of the universe&#8221; as the action which leads to the splintering of the universe into a frightening multiplicity&#8212;and then not only must the characters in the story go back to the origin of the universe themselves in order to prevent the disaster which was caused by somebody observing the origin of the universe, but Wolfman and P&eacute;rez and all the other creators who built the post-Crisis universe necessarily look to the origin of the DC Universe in &#8220;recreating&#8221; it and bringing it &#8220;back to basics.&#8221; According to the mythology of <cite>Crisis</cite>, it&#8217;s practically a cosmological law that <cite class="People">John Byrne</cite> would come along and fuck everything up with his <cite class="Comics">Man of Steel</cite>!</p>
<p>Can anybody who knows more about this stuff than I do tell me if DC still uses Hypertime? Readers, at any rate, seem unaware of it, or at least don&#8217;t seem to consider it as an implicit textual explanation for, say, why the <cite class="People">Jeph Loeb</cite>/<cite class="People">Jim Lee</cite> <cite class="Comics">Batman</cite> is so different from the <cite class="People">Brian Azzarello</cite>/<cite class="People">Eduardo Risso</cite> <cite>Batman</cite>. I know Mark Waid uses Hypertime in <cite class="Comics">The Kingdom</cite>. Are there any Morrison comics that use it? Does it come up in <cite class="Comics">JLA</cite> ever?

<div class="text">
<p>No <cite class="Comics">Animal Man</cite> tonight, but I am quoting <a href="http://ynot.motime.com"><cite class="People">David Fiore</cite></a>, which is practically the same thing, right? At any rate, David was talking about <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1082980729#265154">the barrenness of the superhero-as-myth theory</a> and goes into another digression about a <a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/NinthArt/messages/?msg=1221.1&#038;lgnJR=1">thread he began at the Ninth Art forum</a>. Now that I&#8217;ve read it, it reminds me again that David should stick to blogging and stay off the boards! Part of the reason I haven&#8217;t been on message boards as much for the last two years or so is that I can&#8217;t handle the hysterical tone that gets going sometimes, and I would have utterly lost my mind were I a regular member following that thread and not being able to stop the carnage that follows David wherever he goes. I prefer to be slow and thoughtful and considerate whenever possible, but apparently a lot of people find that dull, and perhaps they&#8217;re right.</p>
<p>However, David quotes <cite class="People">Alasdair Watson</cite>, which is what spurred me to write in the first place:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am not covinced that the a serious dissection of nature of faith, to use my earlier example, is going to be well served when the protagonists must dress in spandex and fire lightning out of various orfices. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not impossible to do, but I think it&#8217;d either come across as a bit of a joke - (see Chuck Austen&#8217;s recent religion-based storylines for examples), or kill the franchise, because lets face it, people come to the X-men for costumes and ass-kicking, not existential crises. Which is my point about not being allowed to do certain things with a given franchise.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think my disagreement with this statement is probably not the same as David&#8217;s, though I&#8217;ve sort of forgtten the specifics of his response by now anyway. First I&#8217;d say that there has to be some combination of ass-kicking and existential crisis to interest most superhero readers, I think, to make things more interesting than a video game. The frighteningly deep emotional attachments don&#8217;t just come from being impressed at how much a favorite hero can benchpress.</p>
<p>I realize that my tastes run heavily to the existential crisis side of things, so I don&#8217;t read too many mainstream superhero books and read other things instead. And I&#8217;m not sure religion was a good example here, because, as with much existential crisis, I wouldn&#8217;t blame the editors or the audience but I&#8217;ll gladly say that many comics writers, mainstream or independent, aren&#8217;t smart or sophisticated to pull it off in a way I&#8217;d find satisfying. Subtle writing is a lot more difficult than just beating up various characters, but a good superhero writer probably has to do both.</p>
<p>And that brings me back to my real question, just what was the pejorative uniform term before <em>spandex</em> was a widespread fabric? Ok, not that at all. What I was actually thinking about was <cite class="People">Marc Singer</cite>&#8217;s <a href="http://notthebeastmaster.typepad.com/weblog/2004/04/metaphor_shmeta.html">denunciation of metaphor</a>. As I said in his comments, I think I use &#8220;metaphor&#8221; the way he uses &#8220;metonymy,&#8221; but I&#8217;m not sure. If a good writer wanted to dissect the nature of faith, what&#8217;s the best way to do it in an <cite class="Comics">X-Men</cite> book? We&#8217;re talking fiction, so straight theology/philosophy wouldn&#8217;t be the way to go, and making Mystique disguise herself as an aardvark dreaming about the Pentateuch seems somehow cliched. If you&#8217;re writing a corporate property, making up a universe to fit your goals and needs like <cite class="People">C.S. Lewis</cite> and <cite class="People">Philip Pullman</cite> did doesn&#8217;t seem to be an option. So you deal with what I&#8217;d call metaphor. You&#8217;ve got Nightcrawler, who I believe is now a Roman Catholic priest, already at your disposal. And Kitty Pryde is Jewish. And if you were a writer after my heart you could somehow remove Dust, the Afghan mutant who somehow wears chador instead of a burqa and exists only to make me afraid of what offensive or exploitative thing Marvel writers might do to her next. So you can deal with real-life religion and how it impacts the lives of the X-Men, tying it up in a story. Or you could make the religion more tangential, or make the faith in the story not have to do with religion at all.</p>
<p>When I talk about metaphor I mean that the stories have resonance with various real-life issues in my life or in the larger world. If I were this writer, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have trouble talking about the nature of faith among the X-Men because they&#8217;re a community of idealists. They exist and justify themselves because of the good they think they&#8217;re doing.  So I&#8217;d write about what it means to have a crisis of faith about being in the X-Men. How do you know whether you&#8217;re just believing what you&#8217;re told? Who decides what&#8217;s right and what punishments wrongdoers receive? How right can it be to do painful, destructive things in the pursuit of righteousness? <cite class="People">Grant Morrison</cite> was getting at a lot of this with his work on <cite class="Comics">New X-Men</cite>, and I was annoyed that he didn&#8217;t follow it farther. The foundations of the mutant dream were shaking and crumbling, and perhaps it didn&#8217;t need to be more explicit, but I thought there were many loose ends. But getting back to my own hypothetical story, I think if I wrote that I&#8217;d be talking about a crisis of faith on mutant terms, an existential crisis in spandex. And I&#8217;ll never get to write it because I don&#8217;t want to and because I wouldn&#8217;t know the first thing about how to stage the ass-kicking, but I hope it could be a more sophisticated dissection of religious thought than <cite class="People">Chuck Austen</cite>&#8217;s &#8220;Catholics are evil because I misunderstand them&#8221; religious comics. </p>
<p>And I&#8217;d call it a metaphor because it is its own part of the story on its own terms but I can read it as being about religion or politics or about how my mother and I just can&#8217;t come to ultimate agreement about my role in life because our priorities and orientations are too different. I&#8217;m not sure if this would qualify for metonym status under Marc&#8217;s criteria, but it seemed like a good chance to explain my mindset. &#8220;Metaphor&#8221; works for me, but I understand the urge to pin things down and to make the connections more literal. Literalism has its weaknesses, but Marc explicitly rejects <a href="http://notthebeastmaster.typepad.com/weblog/2004/04/playing_osama_s.html">the sort that equates American military might with a big lunk punching out Bin Laden</a>, as he should. I think he just wants people to be more willing to pin themselves down in doing comics criticism, which I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m not. This is the best I can do for now.

<p class="postmeta"><a href="../../../../archives/2004/04/index.html" title="April 2004 Archive">26 April 2004</a> by <a href="mailto:ros&#101;.cu&#114;tin&#64;gmail.&#99;om" title="Send an e-mail to Rose">Rose</a> &#8212; Filed under <a href="../../comics/index.html" title="View all posts in Comics" rel="category tag">Comics</a></p>
<div class="text">
<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve talked about comics and I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m ready to talk about any real comics yet (though do expect the long-promised <cite class="Comics">Animal Man</cite> posts to recommence in the next week) but I have been thinking about comic book titles, specifically superhero titles. Specifically I&#8217;ve been wondering about the use of the definite article.</p>
<p>Why does Bruce Banner become <strong>THE</strong> Incredible Hulk when Bruce Wayne is just Batman? Actually, that&#8217;s an easy one, because names with adjectives need something more. The same goes for team names, whether The Avengers or The Justice League of America. Now, I haven&#8217;t gone anywhere near a statistical survey, but it&#8217;s interesting that so many of Batman&#8217;s foes are The Joker, The Riddler, The Penguin&#8230; Tellingly, the definite article seems to attach itself to villains more often than to heroes, denoting a sort of depersonalization. Even more interesting, though, is that it shows up with characters who are heroes but only sort of, problematic types like The Hulk and The Thing and The Martian Manhunter and The Swamp Thing. They&#8217;re still heroes, but not exactly human (and neither is Superman, who somehow gets a free ride).  To get grisly, Batman became The Dark Knight, and The Punisher could hardly be better-named.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not arguing this system works unambiguously. At best, it&#8217;s more a trend than a system at all. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s difficult about The Flash except that just Flash would be a really lousy name. And I guess Wolverine is such a badass that to call him THE Wolverine would be admitting that someone might think there could be another, the utmost heresy. And a lot of animal names take the definite article for no meaningful reasons (beside the already present dehumanizing effect of the animal name), although maybe Janet Van Dyne had to be The Wasp so people wouldn&#8217;t think she was just a WASP.</p>
<p>And because <cite class="People">Steven</cite>&#8217;s just going to comment if I don&#8217;t say this, I&#8217;m not calling The Legion of Super-Pets anti-heroes or problematic protagonists.  They&#8217;re just uniquely identified, because you there&#8217;s no need to have lots of Super-Monkeys running around when you&#8217;ve got Beppo.  Ditto Ace the Bat-Hound.  So there.
