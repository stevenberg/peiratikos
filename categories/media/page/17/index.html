<p><cite class="People">Sean Collins</cite> <a href="http://www.forager23.com/archives/000268.html">annoyed</a> <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/04/22/kill-bill-psa/">people</a> this morning by saying that <a href="http://www.alltooflat.com/about/personal/sean/?BlogNum=773"><cite class="Movies">Kill Bill</cite> detractors should be ignored because they&#8217;re misunderstanding a great movie</a>. I disagree with Sean that any of the characters renounce violence, except maybe the Tiny Yakuza who brings out Beatrix&#8217;s motherly side. And if they don&#8217;t renounce violence, are they all getting punished? Actually, I realize what he said was that &#8220;characters who refuse to renounce violence and deceit are inevitably punished for that refusal.&#8221; So maybe Beatrix escapes on a technicality for not managing to tell lies while dosed with truth serum, and limbless Sophie Fatale didn&#8217;t become headless too because she&#8217;s a coward who squealed. But that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m focusing on here.</p>
<p>In an email, he clarified his thoughts on the aspect of sexual violence that had bothered <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/04/22/kill-bill/"><cite class="People">Steven</cite></a> and <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/04/20/kill-bill-gender/">me</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyway, I&#8217;d talk about the sexualized and exploitative violence&#8211;if,  that is, I thought there was any, which I didn&#8217;t.  Not all violence against  women is sexualized, and I didn&#8217;t think any of it in <cite>Kill Bill</cite> was.  No fetishizing shots of breasts, nipples, legs, crothces, asses, or even  hair, really, just by way of a for instance.  At any rate, it&#8217;s tough to  think of a stronger female character than the Bride, who&#8217;s easily the best action heroine ever (depending, I guess, on whether you like her better than Lt. Ellen Ripley).</p></blockquote>
<p>So maybe it boils down a problem with definitions, what makes some violence sexual and some not. I didn&#8217;t mean the violence was problematic because it involved femmes fatales in boob socks, which seems to be Sean&#8217;s definition of sexual violence. Well, I say it&#8217;s spinach and I say to hell with it. Without talking about which &#8220;worked&#8221; for me as story elements and which didn&#8217;t, I&#8217;m going to make an incomplete list of categorically grouped sex-related violence from both my hazy memories of <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill Vol. 1</cite> and the more recent volume.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some straight-up <strong>sexual violence</strong>. Buck has been accepting money to let men rape Beatrix while she&#8217;s comatose. I&#8217;d argue that the murders in response to this fall in the same general category. Beatrix has no reason to murder these two men except that she&#8217;s been their victim, so she&#8217;s trying to &#8220;right&#8221; the power balance because there&#8217;s nothing she can do about the sex part, which of course is the point. And Esteban slicing up the faces of his prostitutes, that seems like violence as payback for infractions related to sex and power, though we never learn the details.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s <strong>gender-based or sexist violence</strong>. When Gogo slices through the businessman who propositions her, she&#8217;s upsetting social norms and doing something unexpected for a woman. She&#8217;s penetrating and controlling someone who sought to do the same to her. O-Ren has to do the same thing, beat the men at their game of brutality to lead the Yakuza. If Bill is to believed, Pai Mei is a sexist who makes the women in his tutelage work harder and suffer more to prove their ability.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s no lack of <strong>violence in/and romantic or just sexual relationships.</strong> Maybe Esteban&#8217;s role as a sometimes violent pimp fits better here. I don&#8217;t just mean standard intimate violence, but the way sex and violence are intertwined for the characters. Elle kills Budd so she can take credit for offing Beatrix, thinking it will endear her to Bill, not to mention knock out a rival for his affections. And when Elle and Beatrix finally fight, is the extra brutality payback for old hurts or the old girlfriend going after the rival who&#8217;s taken her place? Most obvious, though, is that Bill and Beatrix were obviously having sex, and Bill killed Beatrix after she left him. Whether or not it had to do with his jealousy that he was being replaced in her heart and womb,  when you kill someone you&#8217;ve been sleeping with, it&#8217;s intimate violence and it&#8217;s not uncommon in our world either.</p>
<p><strong>Objectification</strong> seems too subjective to catalogue and was something I didn&#8217;t find too problematic, perhaps because it&#8217;s what Tarantino understands best. I thought  the parallel between the prostitutes in the brothel and Bill&#8217;s Assassin Squad was an insightful one that added depth to the story. And I haven&#8217;t quite figured out the mechanics, but I liked the way Budd didn&#8217;t objectify the strippers he worked with but did treat Beatrix as subhuman when burying her. He treats women who are nothing more than puppets in the movie as characters and belittles (and thus underestimates) the two fully realized women he deals with in the movie. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure if I spent time thinking about it I could come up with more than this, but there isn&#8217;t much of a point. These are issues that hit close to home with me, so I know I&#8217;ll be more strongly affected by them than most viewers, but I don&#8217;t know how anyone could ignore them all or be unaffected by them. I didn&#8217;t think the movie was necessarily exploitative in a porny way, making Uma Thurman some kind of fetish object, but the violence exploited the audience. </p>
<p>Sean also says he&#8217;s avoided analyzing <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill Vol. 2</cite> because he likes it too much to have critical distance. I hope he reconsiders, because I think I can see what aspects people would like, but I&#8217;d love to hear what they actually are. It&#8217;s usually easier to do negative reviews and it can be difficult and self-revealing to talk in any detail about what you like. One of my goals in writing here is to get more comfortable doing both sorts of reviews. I&#8217;m still working on that part, but apparently have no qualms about pressuring others to do what I don&#8217;t.  And Mr. <a href="http://grotesqueanatomy.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_grotesqueanatomy_archive.html#108268068602716824"><cite class="People">John Jakala</cite></a>, this means you!  We who haven&#8217;t yet seen <cite class="Movies">Dogville</cite> want to know why we should!

<div class="text">
<p>Every time somebody <a href="http://www.alltooflat.com/about/personal/sean/?BlogNum=773">says something like this</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.alltooflat.com/about/personal/sean/?BlogNum=773"><p>It&#8217;s really for the best if you ignore the people who didn&#8217;t like Kill Bill Volumes One and Two, which taken together comprise one of the best movies I&#8217;ve ever seen. </p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s really for the best if you ignore them! <cite class="People">Sean Collins</cite> said that. Why, I can&#8217;t imagine. Maybe he&#8217;s joking, but he mostly just sounds indignant. I guess he thinks only people who agree with him are worth paying attention to. How boring.</p>
<p>He also says:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.alltooflat.com/about/personal/sean/?BlogNum=773"><p>I do, however, wish I knew how people can watch a movie in which bad behavior occurs and, because they find the film amusing on some level, deduce that that bad behavior is being endorsed&#8211;particularly in an oeuvre like Tarantino&#8217;s, in which characters who refuse to renounce violence and deceit are inevitably punished for that refusal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I personally didn&#8217;t find the &#8220;bad behavior&#8221; (I guess that would include raping a comatose woman, as well as the comotase woman eating off her rapist&#8217;s face, both pretty bad behavior) amusing, and I didn&#8217;t think the bad behavior was endorsed, so that&#8217;s fine. Actually, scratch that, a lot of the <em>Bride&#8217;s</em> bad behavior was most certainly endorsed, or at least <em>looked upon with some approval</em> by Tarantino&#8212;<a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/04/20/kill-bill-foundations-audience/">and members of the audience</a>. Actually, the way Sean puts it here, which isn&#8217;t really a way I&#8217;d thought about it before, makes the movie seem way more fucked up than I thought at first&#8212;it gives us violent setpieces which are filmed in such a way as to entertain and exhilarate us, and then it says &#8220;Oh, but this violent which is so exciting and fun to watch is bad! These characters must be punished!&#8221;</p>
<p>I wish I knew why <cite class="People">Quentin Tarantino</cite> and people in the audience Rose and I watched it with find this movie so amusing.</p>
<p>Oh, and pointing out other movies that immorally play gratuitous violence for laughs doesn&#8217;t exactly absolve <cite>Kill Bill</cite>&#8230; or maybe Tarantino does it <em>morally</em>?</p>
<p>And really, I came out of the theater thinking <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill Vol. 2</cite> was much better than <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill Vol. 1</cite>, which I sort of liked but had lots of problems with, and I thought &#8220;Hey, get rid of that stupid Buck chapter and <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill</cite> works pretty well,&#8221; but it&#8217;s such a frustrating movie, and I can&#8217;t figure out if it&#8217;s good frustrating or bad frustrating. I fear it&#8217;s both, and I fear Tarantino didn&#8217;t think it was supposed to be frustrating at all.</p>
<p>I do hope we get to hear why <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill</cite> is one of the best movies Sean has ever seen. And Sean, I am curious, given your outspoken views on feminism and misogyny in movies like <cite class="Movies">Dogville</cite>, to hear your thoughts on the issue of sexual and sexually violent exploitation of women characters for entertainment.

<p>Unfortunately, I think <cite class="People">Nate Bruinooge</cite> over at <a href="http://polytropos.org/">Polytropos</a> <a href="http://www.polytropos.org/archives/000375.html">has it right about <cite class="People">Quentin Tarantino</cite> and <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill</cite></a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.polytropos.org/archives/000375.html"><p>Another, darker failing of his that has finally become clear to me is this: he finds abhorrent violence terribly funny. One of his strengths has always been the fact that he does not sugercoat violence, or pussyfoot around its most graphic and troubling aspects. He doesn&#8217;t allow us to get comfortable. But I&#8217;m afraid this may be accidental, because for him the violence we&#8217;re talking about &#8212; a goon splurting blood from a lost limb, a woman thrashing on the floor after losing her last eye &#8212; is already comfortable for him. If this is true it is rather damning of the man, not necessarily his work, though this particular movie seems to be a clear expression of his personal quirks unfettered by editorial critique or high inspiration.</p></blockquote>
<p>I really only have one thing to say about <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill Vol. 1</cite>, I guess (I&#8217;d probably have more to say if I watched again): OK, Buck? Who likes to fuck? How the hell did this shit not end up on the cutting room floor? It&#8217;s stupid, it&#8217;s nonsensical, it&#8217;s one of the most repugnant comedic-abhorrent-violence scenes in either volume of <cite>Kill Bill</cite>. <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill Vol. 2</cite> makes even clearer how wrongheaded the chapter is&#8212;it&#8217;s totally self-contained, it has nothing to do with the rest of the story (except for mild jokes about the Pussy Wagon), it serves only to dilute the sexualized violent relationship between the Bride and Bill. It turns the Bride from a person who was specifically victimized in specific ways by Bill into a general sexually victimized woman. With the Bride and Bill, you don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to read it as some kind of commentary on gendered violence or victimization of women or something, but the Buck chapter pretty well requires a reading pertaining to those themes, since there&#8217;s zero characterization of Buck or the trucker rapist or the Bride anywhere to be found and so there&#8217;s nothing to think about <em>but</em> the general gender politics. So are we supposed to <em>cheer</em> or something when the Bride eats off her rapist&#8217;s face? Jesus. And then we have to say&#8230; Well, gee, is the <em>whole movie</em> about violence against women or something? Is it supposed to be some kind of statement about victimization of women in action movies? Or is the Buck chapter just stupid and nonsensical and totally unrelated to everything else?</p>
<p>Is the movie a repugnant statement or is it just badly designed?</p>
<p>Well, anyway, here&#8217;s what I think about Vol. 2:</p>
<p>The best scenes in the movie manage to be at once trite and powerful. Most of them involve little B.B. Take the scene in which Bill explains to B.B. how he shot Mommy. The dialogue goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Bill:</b> I shot Mommy right in the head.<br />
<b>B.B.:</b> Why, did you want to know what would happen?<br />
<b>Bill:</b> No, I knew what would happen to Mommy when I shot her in the head. But what I didn&#8217;t know&#8230; was what would it would do to <em>me</em>.<br />
<b>B.B.:</b> What did it do to you, Daddy?<br />
<b>Bill:</b> Well, it made Daddy very sad.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s totally ridiculous and trite, but, well, it&#8217;s <em>true</em>, in a way. Tarantino uses B.B. to let his characters say things he could never get away with otherwise. They&#8217;re talking to a child, so they can talk like children. I said the stuff like this is trite, but also powerful, because it cuts right to the core of a lot of action movie morality, which is often painfully na&iuml;ve. Take <cite class="People">John Woo</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Movies">The Killer</cite>. Where did I just see something insightful about John Woo? Ah, right, from <a href="http://theintermittent.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_theintermittent_archive.html#108250206312969061"><cite class="People">Dave Intermittent<cite></cite></cite></a>, in an attempt to formulate a taxonomy of martial arts action movies:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://theintermittent.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_theintermittent_archive.html#108250206312969061"><p>The second type [of martial arts movie] is played straight. Which is not to say realistic; but it takes its own absurdities very seriously. It doesn&#8217;t wink at the audience. And because it takes itself seriously, it can reach for something beyond simply entertaining an audience. Its lunacy becomes contagious; it can aspire to narrative power. Think about (not a kung fu movie, but the point remains) John Woo&#8217;s Hard Boiled. It makes, frankly, no sense at all, either in its narrative or its physics. It&#8217;s honor/betrayal paradigm shouldn&#8217;t really work, given what its yoked to; and explained to people who haven&#8217;t seen the film, it often doesn&#8217;t. But as a movie&#8230;it works. Oh man, how it works. It works because Woo never doubts that it should work, or lets on that he knows it shouldn&#8217;t. Woo never admits that his films are cartoons, and his belief that they aren&#8217;t transmutes them from cartoons into something more.</p></blockquote>
<p><cite>The Killer</cite> is another great example of this kind of movie. Woo obviously wants <cite>The Killer</cite> to be a tragic movie about violent people whose lives and the lives of the people they love end in horrific violence, but the thing is, the violence looks so damn fun! It&#8217;s exactly like a bunch of children playing cops &#038; robbers or cowboys &#038; injuns or the simplest, purest version of childhood violent play, the immortal Guns. Do children still play Guns nowadays? Just run around shooting each other, great fun. <cite>Kill Bill</cite> seems to want to acknowledge the childlike (childish?) quality of play in action movies, most obviously in the toy guns scene. Beatrix has tracked Bill to his home, she stalks through it looking for him, she steps onto the back porch&#8230; where Bill and B.B. stand holding toy guns. After some dramatic narration by Bill, B.B. fires her weapon: &#8220;Bang bang, you&#8217;re dead, Mommy.&#8221; Then Beatrix just stands there, looking at her daugher for the first time in both their lives, and this one closeup of <cite class="People">Uma Thurman</cite> lasts maybe five seconds, and damn if that&#8217;s not about the hardest five seconds of film to watch that I&#8217;ve watched in a while. And ooh, Tarantino <em>gets it</em>, he&#8217;s taken the unconscious childlike-play metaphor of so many action movie gunplay scenes and literalized it. OK, sure, he falls victim to the same childlike ecstasy of violence in this very movie, but really, what an interesting way of dealing with it&#8212;put an actual child in the movie and let&#8217;s see if we can turn those trite statements about violence into something profound(ish). Maybe. Then I just now thought, &#8220;Yeah, but this is the same movie (OK, same two movies) with Buck Who Likes to Fuck, remember?&#8221; and that sort of ruins the effect, I have to admit.</p>
<p>I liked the goldfish scene, too, its parallelism with the Elle Driver scene. Elle is the goldfish outside its tank, flopping around after Beatrix pulls her eyeball out. Then Beatrix stomps on the eyeball&#8212;just like B.B. stomped on her poor goldfish. Yeah, trite and obvious, but that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going for here.</p>
<p>Speaking of Beatrix&#8230; Beatrix? Beatrix Kiddo? I didn&#8217;t get the &#8220;Trix are for kids&#8221; joke until Rose pointed it out to me, and now I wish she hadn&#8217;t, because damn. Why is &#8220;Beatrix Kiddo&#8221; bleeped out in the first movie? What&#8217;s the allusion (there must be one)? Does it have anything to do with anything other than being an allusion? Some of the pastiche works as part of the text&#8212;Rose <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/04/21/kill-bill-bang-bang/">talks a bit about how the Western stuff works</a>&#8212;but too many of the references seem to exist only as references, so that the text becomes sort of a laundry list of movies Tarantino has seen. The name-bleeping may not be the best example, because there&#8217;s a lot of reasonably good stuff about names and identities (the Superman speech! another pretty good scene) and the name-bleeping probably ties in to that. Still. Other seemingly pointless allusions apply. Am I supposed to be impressed that Tarantino has seen every single movie ever made? How boring. Why don&#8217;t I just watch the actual <cite class="Movies">Once Upon a Time in China</cite> and <cite class="Movies">The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</cite> instead?</p>
<p><cite>Kill Bill</cite> frustrates me, you may have noticed. The more I want it to be a good movie, the more I wonder if it doesn&#8217;t want to be a good movie.</p>
<p>It does have some amusing dialogue, though.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Budd:</b> She&#8217;s got a Hanzo sword?<br />
<b>Bill:</b> He made one for her.<br />
<b>Budd:</b> Didn&#8217;t he swear a blood oath to never make another sword?<br />
<b>Bill:</b> It would appear, he has broken it.<br />
<b>Budd:</b> Well&#8230; maybe you just tend to bring that out in people.</p>
<p><b>The Bride:</b> You good with that shotgun?<br />
<b>Janeen:</b> Not that it matters at this range, but I&#8217;m a fuckn&#8217; surgeon with this shotgun!</p></blockquote>

<p>Because I can&#8217;t make <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill</cite> into the story I wish it could be, I&#8217;m open to suggestions. Are there cathartic quest stories about the search for forgiveness? Trite as it sounds, I&#8217;ve found forgiving worth the effort and pain, and I doubt that vengeance could be so satisfying (and certainly not for me), but is this a line of thought borne out in anything that isn&#8217;t a Lifetime Original Movie?

<p class="postmeta"><a href="../../../../archives/2004/04/index.html" title="April 2004 Archive">21 April 2004</a> by <a href="mailto:ste&#118;en&#46;m.&#98;e&#114;&#103;&#64;gma&#105;l.com" title="Send an e-mail to Steven">Steven</a> &#8212; Filed under <a href="../../comics/index.html" title="View all posts in Comics" rel="category tag">Comics</a></p>
<div class="text">
<p>First, <cite class="People">David Fiore</cite> has a piece on <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1082560466#261966">superhero universe continuity</a>, offering an alternative to the &#8220;(non)adherence to past events&#8221; axis used by fanboys and anti-fanboy-fanboys of all kinds. More useful to sophisticated readers is &#8220;awareness of tradition,&#8221; of which &#8220;(non)adherence to continuity&#8221; is only a part. And we can retire &#8220;retcon&#8221; in favor of &#8220;reinterpretation,&#8221; which is all it is. Once we get rid of the comics jargon, we can see that the interesting thing about continuity isn&#8217;t history, it&#8217;s historiography&#8212;it&#8217;s not how the account of Captain America&#8217;s life in <cite class="People">Mark Gruenwald</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Comics">Captain America</cite> contradicts <cite class="People">Jack Kirby</cite>&#8217;s <cite>Captain America</cite> that&#8217;s interesting as much as how Gruenwald&#8217;s interpretation of Cap relates to <cite class="People">Jack Kirby</cite>&#8217;s and those of other creators who&#8217;ve worked with Cap. Good stuff.</p>
<p>Now, <cite class="Comics">The Invisibles</cite> and <cite class="Comics">Crisis on Infinite Earths</cite>. The worlds in <cite>Crisis</cite> are destroyed by a &#8220;wall of anti-matter,&#8221; a white wall the color of a blank sheet of paper progressing implacably across the universes. Just behind the wall of white comes a cloud of inky black, the Antimatter Universe itself filling in the void left by the destruction of each universe. Pages 119-120 (of the <acronym title="trade paperback">TPB</acronym> edition published 2000)  is the best demonstration of this. On page 119, in seven panels that stretch entire height of the page, an image of some planets in the universe containing Earth-1 or Earth-2 (it&#8217;s not clear) goes from full color to increasingly washed-out blue, and the panels become increasingly narrow, until the seventh &#8220;panel&#8221; is an absence, without even a panel border, a unmarked field of white paper from the right side of the sixth panel all the way to the edge of the page. Page 120 has nine panels in a regular grid&#8212;the first panel again defines a negative space of blank white paper with no panel border, the second and third panels show wisps of gray gas or smoke moving in from the corners of the negative space, and the second and third rows of panels show the space filling with smoke until the final panel is the opposite of the first, a rectangle of black. Well, well, what could all this mean? Let&#8217;s let the Harbinger explain the Crisis.</p>
<blockquote><p>Please, listen to me, for our current crisis began <i>ten billion years ago</i>&#8230; The Earth was little more than cooling <i>gases</i>, showing none of the possibilities <i>time</i> would someday offer.</p>
<p>No, the Crisis began <i>elsewhere</i>&#8230; on the world called <i>Oa</i>&#8212; a world of immorals&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;of limitless <i>hope</i>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;and of endless possibilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Harbinger speaks, her speech bubbles are superimposed on images of the planet Oa and its enlightend inhabitants.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Oans lived in paradise. Their minds and bodies were things of perfection. In such a world one would expect a <i>winding down</i>&#8230; a lessening of continued advancement&#8230; but such was <i>not</i> the case. They strove always for improvement of the mind and spirit&#8230;</p>
<p>Their science has never been equaled&#8230; but there were some who used their powers for their own twisted desires.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now just wait till you see what those &#8220;twisted desires&#8221; were&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>[Concerned Oan:] &#8220;Krona, you <i>know</i> the legends&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>[Krona:] &#8220;Bah! Such stories are tales only <i>fools</i> would fear. I seek to learn the <i>origin of the universe</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>[Krona:] &#8220;And you talk of the legends of <i>destruction</i> should I learn the truth. You are a <i>dolt</i>!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Krona&#8217;s not much like the other Oans. Sure, he&#8217;s blue like the rest of them, but he&#8217;s larger, stockier, he looks like he could kick most of their asses, and like he wants to. He&#8217;s always sneering, and he&#8217;s always drawn in closeup from below, so we&#8217;re looking right up his nose and he looks like a pig.</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite all pleas, Krona continued his ceasless labors&#8230;</p>
<p>[Krona:] &#8220;An image forming? A <i>shadow</i>&#8230; like a giant hand&#8230; with something&#8230; a cluster of <i>stars</i> inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then it happened. A terrible cosmic bolt splintered his machine and would have destroyed Krona, too, had he not been immortal&#8230;</p>
<p>It was not the end of the universe as the Oan legends foretold&#8230; but the beginning of something new&#8230;</p>
<p>Something terrible!</p>
<p>Something&#8230; evil&#8230;</p>
<p>The universe <i>shuddered</i>&#8230; and the evil <i>antimatter universe</i> was formed. But more than that&#8212;the <i>single universe was replicated</i>. What was <i>one</i> became many. At that moment was born both the <i>antimatter universe and the multiverse</i>.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>There&#8217;s</em> a &#8220;twisted desire&#8221; for you&#8212;wanting to know the origin of the universe makes you evil! This is an epistemological critique of the state of the pre-Crisis DC universe, as <cite class="People">Geoff Klock</cite> argues in his book <cite class="Books">How to Read Superhero Comics and Why</cite>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;by looking into origins, existence is splintered into a variety of mutually exclusive interpretations that have no center. The current state of the DC universe&#8212;all of the continuity problems and confusions and paradoxes&#8212;Umberto Eco&#8217;s oneiric climate&#8212;is the retroactive result of looking too closely for a guiding principle (p. 20).</p></blockquote>
<p>Creators playing in the DC universe constantly reinterpret and build upon the past, and those reinterpretations were actually incorporated into the fictional world through the multiverse concept. <cite class="Comics">Flash</cite> with Barry Allen isn&#8217;t just a reinterpretation of the Jay Garrick <cite>Flash</cite> comics, it actually takes place in the next universe over and Barry can vibrate through the boundary and have a chat with Jay. It&#8217;s like the theory of temporal physics in which every probabilistic event causes one timeline to split into several timelines, one for each probabilistic outcome. The problem is, how do you know which is the original timeline? How do you distinguish Truth from the countless interpretations of the Truth? <cite class="People">Marv Wolfman</cite> and <cite class="People">George P&eacute;rez</cite> think they have an resolution to this crisis: <em>don&#8217;t look</em>. If you think you know the truth and you look to verify it, you&#8217;ll just end up finding all these interpretations of the truth, and how do you know <em>your</em> truth isn&#8217;t just another interpretation, and if it is then how do you figure out which one of the needles in this stack of needles is the <em>real</em> truth? Nasty question. So let&#8217;s say&#8230; <em>this</em> needle is the real one, and all these other needles&#8212;let&#8217;s just have the Anti-Monitor get rid of those ones, shall we? Tragic to lose all those needles, but at least now we only have one, and that&#8217;s much more convenient.</p>
<p><ins datetime="2004-04-21T21:46Z">[Insertion, added 9:46 UTC] And obviously, the advancing antimatter wall is encroaching nihihlism. According to Wolfman and P&eacute;rez, the inevitable result of a multiplicity of interpretations of the truth is that we are all consumed by nihilism&#8212;unless some band of heroes manages to stop the nihilists (usually &#8220;postmodernists,&#8221; outside of superhero comics) from infecting the rest of the world with their poisonous &#8220;There is no truth!&#8221; philosophy. The metaphor arguably breaks down when the heroes&#8217; method for defeating nhilism is to punch it <em>a lot</em>&#8230; or does it break down? Maybe physical combat is a good metaphor for the epistemological battle to save Truth.</ins></p>
<p>But what does <cite class="People">Grant Morrison</cite> have to say about all this in <cite class="Comics">The Invisibles</cite>? That&#8217;s the question for next time!

<p><a href="http://comics.toonzone.net/solicitations/2004-07/marvel.php">Marvel solicitations</a> for <cite class="Comics">Kabuki</cite> and <cite class="Comics">Powers</cite> are probably going to make somebody mad:</p>

From the award-winning writer and artist of Daredevil that brought you &#8220;Parts of a Hole,&#8221; &#8220;Wake Up,&#8221; and &#8220;Echo,&#8221; this new series marks the 10th anniversary of Kabuki and features a special chronology of Kabuki&#8217;s early beginnings, including never-before-published Kabuki art by Brian Michael Bendis.</p></blockquote>

<p>Can you <em>believe</em> that? &#8220;From the award-winning writer and artist of Daredevil&#8221;??? &#8220;From the writer of some of your favorite Marvel comics&#8221;??? Now all the stupid Marvel Zombies will buy these books <em>for no good reason</em> and the comics industry will drive me to hang myself after slitting my wrists!</p>
<p>Yeah, and does <cite class="People">Chris Claremont</cite> have a clause in his special X-Men contract that specifies every third cover of a comic book he writes must feature a mysterious villain standing over the fallen bodies of the X-Men? You&#8217;d think at some point some villain would think, &#8220;Damn, here I am standing over the fallen bodies of the X-Men, why don&#8217;t I just <em>kill the bastards</em> and be done with it?&#8221; But apparently this never occurs to them, which is why they&#8217;re villains&#8212;because we all know Good Guys always win, so you must be stupid to be a Bad Guy.</p>

<p>You know this <cite class="Comics">Powerless</cite> comic, the one that&#8217;s a What If? story but I guess we&#8217;re not calling them that anymore?</p>
<blockquote cite="http://comics.toonzone.net/solicitations/2004-07/marvel.php"><p>By re-imagining Marvel&#8217;s most popular characters without superhuman powers, this series will strip these heroes to their core, exploring what it means to be a hero in very human terms.</p></blockquote>
<p>What if Matt Murdock, Peter Parker, and Logan didn&#8217;t have powers, would they still be heroes or would they just be like a regular lawyer, a regular student/photographer, and a regular amnesiac Canadian or whatever the fuck Logan is? You know, considering Logan was born about 150 years ago or so, if he weren&#8217;t a mutant then wouldn&#8217;t he be <em>dead</em>? I bet Wolverine&#8217;s subplot in <cite>Powerless</cite> is that you just get page after page of his tombstone.</p>
<p>No, actually, judging by the cover image below, Logan&#8217;s answer to the question &#8220;What does it mean to be a hero?&#8221; is &#8220;Claws!&#8221;</p>

<div class="text">
<p>The real climax of <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill Vol. 2</cite> comes at the end of the credits.  The Bride has found herself a new identity, one that&#8217;s not chosen for her but actually chosen.  Just because she drives off into the sunset as Mommy doesn&#8217;t mean she&#8217;ll be Mommy forever, but it is a new start. There&#8217;s a liminal moment where this change begins to take hold, in a doorway no less! Gun in hand, Beatrix spins to face the most cunning trap Bill could have set, beatific B.B. holding a toy gun. After a painfully long moment of shock, Mommy falls, in the clearest (and maybe first) display of real emotion in all of <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill</cite>.</p>
<p>Of course, Daddy has been a bad Daddy, and not just because he lets B.B. stay up past her bedtime to watch <cite class="Movies">Shogun Assassin</cite>. Bill tried to kill Beatrix in what he describes as a fit of agony over lost love, which also included anger and betrayal that he&#8217;s lost his favorite toy. Daddy metes out gentle punishment to B.B., firmly discussing the death of her fish and the guilt she feels over her role in it. He hasn&#8217;t grown more kind or fair to B.B.&#8217;s mommy, whom he shoots again, this time with a dart that gives him the power to extract truth from her against her will. Can this &#8220;marriage&#8221; be saved? </p>
<p>Beatrix has made a lot of choices in her life, but we don&#8217;t get to see them. Her only backstory is a glimpse of what she was with Bill, a lovelorn assassin, and what she is because of Bill, the vengeful Bride.  Bill and the Vipers wiped out the wedding party and the hope of a new life, and Beatrix has done in the Vipers, so those two identities have been destroyed. &#8220;Beatrix Kiddo&#8221; is a name suitable for the sort of jokes it inspires in the movies, and she doesn&#8217;t seem to be in a hurry to go back to that. But suddenly on the floor of a California mansion she finds an alternative. Her story won&#8217;t be over when she kills Bill because now she once again has something to live for!</p>
<p>Beatrix and Bill have been locked in a power struggle for years. Young Beatrix submits to Pai Mei both to prove to Bill that she can (thus proving his warnings wrong) and to make him proud, and indeed it turns out she succeeds more thoroughly than Bill realized at the time. Bill enjoys his control over Beatrix and the Viper Squad disintegrates once that link is lost. Is this mutually destructive bond some Grand Passion or just a standard abusive cycle? And how does little B.B. fit in? Daddy and Mommy both love her very much (or do they?) but they don&#8217;t love each other anymore (right?) and so it&#8217;s better for everybody if they resolve their disputed custody with a fight to the death! It makes no difference to little B.B. whether Daddy cared for her out of love or for Beatrix or to atone for his violent past (and present) or just because he knew it would make Beatrix more angry. She had a Daddy and she had a life, and now she has a Mommy and a new life. Has anything really changed?</p>
<p>In Westerns, a cowboy heads off into the sunset because he hasn&#8217;t been domesticated, hasn&#8217;t settled down. If he wanted to complete his Oedipal trajectory, he&#8217;d find a nice woman (or make a woman nice) and start a solid life for himself in town or on a homestead. In becoming Mommy, Beatrix is trying to twist this. She&#8217;s domesticating herself, switching from murderer to caregiver in a matter of minutes. It may not work this way and may not work for good, since she&#8217;s left two little girls half-orphans in a revenge culture, but she&#8217;s a determined woman when she puts her mind to a task. She&#8217;s still defining herself through her relation to someone else, but that&#8217;s what has to happen to some extent if you live in society, and now she has someone who depends on her, has power she can use to do great good. It&#8217;s a wide horizon, full of promise, and mother and daugher are heading right in, not looking back.

But there are still not enough comics readers to support books like &#8220;Wildcats 3.0&Prime; and &#8220;Stormwatch: Team Achilles.&#8221; This tells me that not only is the average mainstream comic reader functionally illiterate, as well as sincerely retarded, but that we have a deeply unhealthy industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK? Got it? You might think Tim&#8217;s insults are pretty offensive, but really I think we all know, even if we don&#8217;t like to admit it&#8230; we really <em>are</em> a bunch of semi-literate retards, aren&#8217;t we? It&#8217;s why we read comics&#8212;we can&#8217;t read them, but we can look at the pictures.</p>
<p>Now, maybe you didn&#8217;t get <cite class="Comics">Stormwatch: Team Achilles</cite> because you were too busy reading other comics you like. Maybe you didn&#8217;t get <cite class="Comics">Wildcats Version 3.0</cite> because you have limited funds and can&#8217;t afford to buy every superhero comic that&#8217;s &#8220;critically acclaimed&#8221; and you decided to read <cite class="Comics">New X-Men</cite> or <cite class="Comics">X-Statix</cite> instead. Maybe you just don&#8217;t like superhero comics, or you don&#8217;t like military science fiction, or you don&#8217;t like stories about corporate politics. Maybe you were too busy reading your &#8220;art&#8221; comics? Too busy with <cite class="Comics">Persepolis</cite> to support <cite>Stormwatch</cite>? Whatever. We&#8217;re talking good, critically acclaimed comics here, and they needed your support! Oh, you didn&#8217;t think they sounded interesting to you? I guess you&#8217;re a retarded illiterate conservative fanboy, huh? I guess you suck?</p>
<p>You know what else I hate? The fact that <cite class="Comics">Powers</cite> and <cite class="Comics">Kabuki</cite> are guaranteed to quintuple, if not sextuple, their sales when they move from Image to Marvel. Maybe even <em>septuple</em>. There&#8217;s nothing I hate more than Marvel Zombies buying good comics. I&#8217;d rather see these comics get cancelled for low sales than see people buy them for the <em>wrong reasons</em>!</p>
<p>Stupid fanboys. Everything is your fault.</p>

<p>I just lost a really long post about <cite class="People">Grant Morrison</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Comics">The Invisibles</cite>, which probably won&#8217;t teach me to save my work as I write even though it should. Well, here&#8217;s a somewhat shortened version.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the difference between Jack and Boy in a nutshell, from <cite class="Comics">Kissing Mister Quimper</cite>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Boy: &#8220;&#8230;There&#8217;s gotta be more to life than running <i>all</i> the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack: &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s gotta be it, ey? I don&#8217;t know: I just run &#8216;cause it&#8217;s quicker than <i>walking</i>, me.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I had an utterly brilliant comparison between Boy&#8217;s leaving the Invisibles and Cipher&#8217;s trying to get back into the Matrix in <cite class="Comics">The Matrix</cite>! Alas, alas. It&#8217;s a pretty obvious difference, though: Cipher is an asshole who betrays his crewmates, Boy is the first Invisible to really get an important part of what&#8217;s going on. Let&#8217;s look at some narration from the last issue of <cite>Invisibles</cite>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m there at the end of the world that was and the beginning of birth into full understanding&#8212;fusion with the supercontext. I am part of &#8220;nature.&#8221; Every airplane, every power station is a result of &#8220;Nature&#8217;s&#8221; process. We never fell. We were never apart from the world. We lied to ourselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>That applies to humanity as a whole&#8212;we thought we were fallen and reaching up toward God or enlightenment (religious people thought so, anyway), but we&#8217;re only a fetus trying to be born. It also applies to the Invisibles specifically, who think they&#8217;re separate from the normal world. Jack calls the non-Invisible world the &#8220;fucking land of the dead,&#8221; but he&#8217;s wrong. Running may be quicker than walking, but walking gets you moving forward all the same.</p>
<blockquote><p>But now we&#8217;re being born, fully-grown, like insects, like Athena, the Goddess of Truth. Larval consciousness experiences the introduction of necessary inoculating agents from the supercontext as a form of invasion by hostile, bacterial forces. The inoculation is conceptualized by the developing larva as an invasion of threatening &#8220;not-self&#8221; material&#8230; the confronting and integration of &#8220;not-self&#8221; being a necessary stage in the development of the maturing larva&#8217;s self-awareness&#8212;&#8221;philogeny recapitulates history.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is what Boy figured out: you don&#8217;t need to be Invisible to help bring the world to birth. As long as the Invisibles stand apart from the world, they&#8217;re as much &#8220;not-self&#8221; as the Lost Ones and other followers of the Outer Church. You want to integrate with the &#8220;not-self&#8221;? Go talk to your neighbor. Go have sex and have a baby&#8212;genetic metaphor of the synthesis of self and not-self. It&#8217;s not that the Invisibles are bad, not that all the Invisibles should be like Boy. It&#8217;s just that their purpose is not to save the world from the Outer Church or from itself, but to engage in the process of integration. Mr. Six and some others do it by blurring the distinction between Invisible and Outer Church until the whole thing is a hopeless mess of quadruple agents and nobody knows who&#8217;s on what side. Jack does it by eating the Outer Church&#8217;s King of the new Aeon. King Mob does it by inventing a video game/drug that turns people into Invisibles. Lord Fanny does it with genderbending. Ragged Robin does it by writing herself into the story. Boy, maybe the most radical Invisible of all, does it by going home and living a little life.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what superheroes like Neo and Friends in <cite>The Matrix</cite> never quite figure out: you can&#8217;t save the world by treating the people in it like helpless cattle. If they really rely on you to rescue them from the Forces of Darkness and Control, the only thing you accomplish by rescuing them is to set <em>yourself</em> as the new Forces of Darkness  and Control. Neo&#8217;s going to free all the humans from the Matrix? And what gives him the right to make that decision for the entire species? This is part of what Boy means when she says, &#8220;I stopped needing to save the world. Saving is what misers do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tomorrow: Philogeny recapitulates history? Spurious biology, memes, and <cite>The Invisibles</cite> as critical response to <cite class="Comics">Crisis on Infinite Earths</cite>!

<p class="postmeta"><a href="../../../../archives/2004/04/index.html" title="April 2004 Archive">20 April 2004</a> by <a href="mailto:rose.curtin&#64;&#103;ma&#105;l&#46;com" title="Send an e-mail to Rose">Rose</a> &#8212; Filed under <a href="../../movies/index.html" title="View all posts in Movies" rel="category tag">Movies</a></p>
<div class="text">
<p>I&#8217;m still not into the meat of my discussion of <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill</cite>, but I have a few comments about the moviegoing experience. I don&#8217;t like being in crowds much in general, and I particularly dislike it in movie theaters. It&#8217;s possible that I gravitate to non-Hollywood movies in part because there will be fewer people in the audience to make me wonder whether they&#8217;re observing me and, if so, what they think. But we were lucky both times to be in fairly sparsely populated theaters, and I&#8217;m getting over my awkwardness anyway, so it worked out, although there were tough spots. </p>
<p>What I hadn&#8217;t expected was that <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill Vol. 2</cite> would be such a comedy classic, at least if the audience was to be trusted. They thought all the fight scenes were exhilarating and funny and any character mannerisms were hysterical, particularly Pai Mei&#8217;s beard toss. I realize I have a stronger than normal response to violence, but I guess I&#8217;d hoped people would be more shocked or disturbed than amused by at least some of the fights. Then again, maybe the horrified people were as quiet as I was. On the other hand, the audience seemed at best lukewarm toward the dialogue, shifting awkwardly during any emotional episodes.  I was somewhat chagrined by the family behind us, who had brought two elementary school children with them, but I&#8217;m sure there are benefits to introducing violent imagery early, at least one of which is that it will keep your kid from growing up like me.</p>
<p><cite class="Movies">Kill Bill Vol. 1</cite> was a different setup. There was a group of maybe four college-aged guys and another couple there, and that may have been it, so there were two women watching the movie.  The more recent crowd had something like a 3:1 ratio, I guess. The first crowd, particularly the guys, laughed some and sort of grunted approvingly during action sequences, but it mostly seemed to be in keeping with what I saw as the tone of the movie. Maybe it was what seemed like a drastic change in tone between the two that made the second audience so rambunctious. All I know is that it took me a long time to settle in because of the ridiculous giggles, and that I probably liked the movie less because of it, but that&#8217;s a criticism of myself as a viewer.</p>
<p>The reason I&#8217;m writing this at all is because I never got a sense of intended audience for the film. It&#8217;s possible the intended audience is just <cite class="People">Quentin Tarantino</cite>, but I don&#8217;t know. I just don&#8217;t know if the rest of our audience left wondering whether Bill had loved The Bride and whether he would have been able to stop hurting her, and to what extent her total adoration had made him want to hurt her in the first place. I know one audience is geeks, the kind of people who are excited by the namedropping and the intertextuality, and that&#8217;s a valid group. I just wonder whether <cite>Kill Bill</cite> would have been better served by being less accessible and making viewers work a little harder to enjoy and appreciate it. Should it have attracted the same audience that went to see <cite class="Movies">The Punisher</cite>? I guess I was hoping the answer would be no, because I&#8217;m so sick of revenge stories glorifying that ideology and am not much of a fan of women-in-peril pieces, though <cite>Kill Bill</cite> managed to subvert that at least a bit. <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/04/15/red-right-hand/">As with <cite class="Movies">Hellboy</cite></a>, I might have liked it more if it had been targeted at me more closely, but I liked it enough on its own merits. A lot of things would be easier if I were a fanboy, but I&#8217;m much happier as is, even if it means silently cursing moviegoers while they laugh and laugh. They should be glad I don&#8217;t support revenge!
