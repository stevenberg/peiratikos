<p>I can&#8217;t find an official transcript, but what&#8217;s burned into my brain from hearing his statement live on the radio driving in here is that our prez sez, &#8220;May God bless the Iraqi people and continue to bless America.&#8221; I know I have the total lack of parallel structure there right because I immediately yelled at the radio, which is not something I generally do. </p>
<p>Yeah, now that we Americans have killed a terrorist by means of an air strike, that is what Bush calls &#8220;justice.&#8221; He still seems pretty keen on the trial of Saddam Hussein, which makes sense to me, but I guess blowing people up makes for better press conferences. However the really important thing is that now that this decidedly unsavory fellow has been wiped off the face of the earth we can finally start hoping that Iraq gets some special treats from God, who had previously been withholding his divine support for fear it might accidentally land on a Jordanian terrorist when he (and while I&#8217;m pretty sure Bush&#8217;s second phrase didn&#8217;t have a pronoun, let&#8217;s not kid ourselves about which one he&#8217;d choose) wasn&#8217;t paying attention or something. But hey, don&#8217;t let anyone forget who has God&#8217;s Most Favored Nation status. I was and continue to be sad and furious.

<p>Ah, not blogging is fun. Maybe blogging can be fun too?</p>
<p>Um, but what to blog about? Rose and I saw <cite class="Movies">Brokeback Mountain</cite> a few days ago. <cite class="People">Jake Gyllenhaal</cite> and <cite class="People">Heath Ledger</cite> are so brave! Fah.</p>
<p>I was going to mention how it&#8217;s not exactly a universal love story, since people whose love doesn&#8217;t deviate from normative restrictions aren&#8217;t encouraged to fear and despise themselves, aren&#8217;t murdered for the crime of existing or driven into a traumatized unlife in the closet. Then I read the <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18712"><cite class="Magazines">New York Review of Books</cite> review</a>, so I&#8217;ll just link to that instead. Because I&#8217;m lazy.</p>
<p>I will say this: universality is overrated. Universal themes: who cares? They&#8217;re generic, we&#8217;ve seen them a million times before. The specificity is what makes stories worth reading! And the specificity is especially important in <cite>Brokeback Mountain</cite>, where <a href="http://www.godhatesfags.com/">the specific story is real and happening right now</a>. There are people&#8212;maybe not as many as there used to be, but still far too many&#8212;who would watch <cite>Brokeback Mountain</cite> and rejoice in Jack and Ennis&#8217;s misery. (They&#8217;d probably be sad about the broken marriages, though.) There are many men who won&#8217;t see the movie because they fear the image of gay sex. That&#8217;s what the story&#8217;s about: denial, hatred and fear of sexuality, a man who can&#8217;t overcome his fear and kills his own soul as thoroughly as other fearful men kill his would-be lover.</p>
<p>I just thought of something. Did anybody praise <cite class="People">Liam Neeson</cite> and <cite class="People">Peter Sarsgaard</cite> for playing bisexual in <cite class="Movies">Kinsey</cite>?</p>

<p><a href="http://theintermittent.blogspot.com/2006_03_01_theintermittent_archive.html#114126802143435365">Isn&#8217;t it sad that the little girls can&#8217;t read <cite class="Comics">Wonder Woman</cite>?</a> (Um, what about the little <em>boys</em>?) I was gonna say the little girls are being denied their veiled bondage quasi-porn, but it occurred to me they they must be getting <em>plenty</em> of that in their manga.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/lincoln.htm"><cite class="People">Abraham Lincoln</cite></a> (from <a href="http://www.positiveatheism.org/">Posivite Atheism</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>My earlier views of the unsoundness of the Christian scheme of salvation and the human origin of the scriptures, have become clearer and stronger with advancing years and I see no reason for thinking I shall ever change them.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>When the Know-Nothings get control, it [the Declaration of Independence] will read: &#8220;All men are created equal except negroes, foreigners and Catholics.&#8221; When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty &#8212; to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Allow the President to invade a neighboring nation whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an invasion and you allow him to do so whenever he may choose to say he deems it necessary for such purpose, and you allow him to make war at pleasure&#8230;.</p>
<p>If today he should choose to say he thinks it necessary to invade Canada to prevent the British from invading us, how could you stop him? You may say to him, &#8220;I see no probability of the British invading us,&#8221; but he will say to you, &#8220;Be silent; I see it, if you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/jefferson.htm"><cite class="People">Thomas Jefferson</cite></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To talk of immaterial existences is to talk of <i>nothings</i>. To say that the human soul, angels, god, are immaterial, is to say they are nothings, or that there is no god, no angels, no soul. I cannot reason otherwise &#8230; without plunging into the fathomless abyss of dreams and phantasms. I am satisfied, and sufficiently occupied with the things which are, without tormenting or troubling myself about those which may indeed be, but of which I have no evidence.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the Supreme Being as his father, in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Believing that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their Legislature should &#8220;make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,&#8221; thus building <i>a wall of separation</i> between Church and State.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Dr. Rush told me (he had it from Asa Green) that when the clergy addressed General Washington, on his departure from the government, it was observed in their consultation that he had never, on any occasion, said a word to the public which showed a belief in the Christian religion, and they thought they should so pen their address as to force him at length to disclose publicly whether he was a Christian or not. However, he observed, the old fox was too cunning for them. He answered every article of their address particularly, except that, which he passed over without notice.</p></blockquote>
