<p><strong>Update: Although the posts have been deleted, the comments threads still exist. I&#8217;ve saved copies of them in case they disappear as well, though. I&#8217;ve added links to the comments threads.</strong></p>
<p>Michael E, <a href="http://fanboyrampage.blogspot.com/">Fanboy Rampage</a> guestblogger extraordinaire, has taken to deleting his own guestblogging posts&#8212;which, at the very least, leaves <a href="http://fanboyrampage.blogspot.com/2004_10_01_fanboyrampage_archive.html#109770450890532791">Chris Butcher&#8217;s followup post</a> stranded in a context-free void. Alas, I was unable to rescue Michael&#8217;s second post from oblivion, but I captured his first before it disappeared. I reproduce it here:</p>

<p>Oh, I just noticed another deleted post I saved from oblivion:</p>
<blockquote><div>
<p>Ande Parks, inker of Green Arrow, on <a href="http://www.onipress.com/community">the Oni Press boards</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;Aside from the obviously close-minded mentality that no doubt enables a lot of this &#8220;outrage&#8221;, what annoys me is the notion that authors ought to keep their personal agendas out of their work.</p>
<p>I have a word for those who keep their personal agendas out of their work&#8230; hacks. Even in a situation like Green Arrow, where the author is working with someone else&#8217;s property, what is the fucking point of it if the writer doesn&#8217;t come in with something to say? If they think Grell didn&#8217;t have an agenda, they weren&#8217;t paying attention. This is what Judd is passionate about, and passion is required to produce worthwhile art.&#8221;</p>

<p>For some reason, about half of the search keyphrases by which people have stumbled upon <a href="http://peiratikos.net/">Peiratikos</a> lately are <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0266697/"><cite class="Movies">Kill Bill</cite></a>-related.

<div class="text">
<p>In <a href="http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/"><cite class="People">Peter David</cite>&#8217;s</a> new <cite class="Comics">Madrox</cite> miniseries, the characters, including Jamie Madrox, talk like there&#8217;s a <em>Jamie</em>, and then there are a bunch of <em>duplicate Jamies</em>. Like at one point, Jamie says, &#8220;&#8230;last night I waffled on staying in or going out. So I sent a dupe out to have a good time for me,&#8221; as if the Jamie who stayed home last night had more claim to Madroxness than a mere &#8220;dupe.&#8221; How does this work? Are dupes mere copies who are somehow imperfect, so that it&#8217;s obvious which one is the real Jamie? Does the real Jamie have a special, intangible quality of Madroxness that the dupes lack? Or do they simply agree to arbitrarily select one of the Jamies to act as the &#8220;real&#8221; Jamie for convenience? I can see how it would get confusing if you had several separate physical bodies, with no psyhic connection between them, and every body thought of and talked about himself as &#8220;I,&#8221; and also talked about every other body as &#8220;I.&#8221; Or &#8220;we&#8221;? It&#8217;d certainly be confusing for people who had to talk to or about more than one of you at once, but it would also have to fuck with your own sense of self. Most superheroes have a dual identity, but Madrox the Multiple Man may embody the identity-based conflicts of superheroes more than any other character.</p>
<p>I also wonder where the X-Men get the cool t-shirts with their logos on them. Jean Grey-Summers wore a Phoenix shirt for a while in <cite class="Comics">New X-Men</cite>, and now Jamie has one in <cite>Madrox</cite>. Do the X-Men have these shirts custom-made for them, or can you buy Phoenix and Multiple Man shirts at <a href="http://www.hottopic.com/">Hot Topic</a> in the Marvel universe?</p>
<p>(Speaking of Hot Topic, they have a back-to-school sale on school supplies at their store right now. Hot Topic having a back-to-school sale on school supplies has got to win a Hilarity Prize.)

<p>Brief History Of Linux (#13)<br />
Wanted: Eunuchs programmers</p>
<p>Everything you know about the creation of the Unix operating system is wrong. We have uncovered the truth: Unix was a conspiracy hatched by Ritchie and Thompson to thwart the AT&#038;T monopoly that they worked for. The system, code-named EUNUCHS (Electronic UNtrustworthy User-Condemning Horrible System), was horribly conceived, just as they had planned.</p>
<p>The OS, quickly renamed to a more respectable &#8220;Unix,&#8221; was adopted first by Ma Bell????????s Patent Department and then by the rest of the monopoly. AT&#038;T saw an inexpensive, multi-user, portable operating system that it had all rights to; the authors, however, saw a horrible, multi-crashing system that the Evil Ma Bell Empire would become hopelessly dependent on. AT&#038;T would go bankrupt trying to maintain the system and eventually collapse.</p>
<p>That didn????????t happen. Ritchie and Thompson were too talented to create a crappy operating system; no matter how hard they tried the system was too good. Their last ditch effort to sabotage the system by recoding it obfuscated C was unsuccessful. Before long Unix spread outside of Bell Labs and their conspiracy collapsed.</p>
