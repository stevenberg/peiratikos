<div class="text">
<p>I&#8217;m pretty deeply depressed right now and not able to grapple with regular blogging, but here&#8217;s some knitting I&#8217;ve been doing to pass the time and prove to myself I can accomplish things.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brododaktula/315208104/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/107/315208104_9786609521.jpg?v=0" height="240" width="180" alt="Rose wearing her bell-sleeved jacket" class="ralign"/></a><strong>Pattern</strong>: <a href="http://vogueknitting.com/images/2006holiday/VKH06TOWN6.jpg">#15 Bell Sleeve Jacket</a>, from <cite class="Magazines">Vogue Knitting International</cite>, designed by <cite class="People">Daniel Adamczyk</cite>.<br />
<strong>Yarn</strong>: Naturelle Aran 10-Ply, 100% wool<br />
<strong>Gauge</strong>: 16 sts/24 rows = 4 inches or 10 cm on US size 6 needles<br />
<strong>Size</strong>: XS (at my gauge, this gave the Medium width indicated in the pattern)<br />
<strong>Knitting Dates</strong>: 21 October 2006 - 22 November 2006</p>
<p><strong>Modifications</strong>: Many!<br />
I knew from the start that I didn&#8217;t want to close the sweater with a belt and decided on hook-and-eye tape instead (although I have to resew it so that the edges fit more tightly than in the photo above). With the yarn I&#8217;d chosen, I was more comfortable with the fabric I got at 4 stitches/inch than 5, so I was able to follow the XS instructions to get a Medium width sweater, following the Medium or my own directions for how long to make various pieces. </p>
<p>I quickly decided not to make a collar once it became clear that the collar would be 13 inches long in the back, which seemed excessive. Instead I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brododaktula/291928459/in/set-72057594123027978/">carried the inner cable</a> up the front and attached it to the back neck, which I made about an inch lower than the pattern called for. I used short rows to shape the back cable part and left an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brododaktula/299037916/in/set-72057594123027978/">open section</a> to transition from right-curving to left-curving cables. I also changed the way the decreases toward the shoulder worked on the front so I&#8217;d end up with the same number of stitches as the back. The picture in the magazine shows a second line of knits with reverse stockinette separating the two, but this is not what the pattern specifies. I also used short rows for the shoulders on front and back, as well as for the back collar opening.</p>
<p>Since I wasn&#8217;t attaching the collar, the extra rows on the front edges to which the collar gets attached seemed superfluous and I didn&#8217;t much like the idea of matching reverse stockinette to orthogonal stockinette at the bottom. For a bottom edging to the garment, I used a provisional cast-on so I would have free stitches at the end once my seaming was done. I then knitted up the pattern at the bottom of the sleeve, though without the decreases for added bell effect; I just cast on the closest number of stitches to my live stitches that was a multiple of 8 (plus two selvedges for the front edges). I kitchener stitched this bottom flare to the live stitches. This added 2 inches in length, where the pattern-specified reverse stockinette (in my gauge at least) would have been about 0.5 inches.</p>
<p>Last, I worked an edging in double knitting with a garter stitch selvedge (Cast on 8 sts. or other even number. Row one: K1, *k1,  slip 1 purlwise with yarn in back,* repeat from * to end. Row 2: *Slip 1 purlwise with yarn in back, k1* repeat from * to end.) I attached it to the garter selvedge on the inside edge of the sweater by alternating mattress stitching one stitch of the sweater to one of the edging and one of the sweater to two of the edging, going in under two stitch bars before coming up for the next stitch on the sweater side. This gave me a tension that didn&#8217;t buckle in but also wasn&#8217;t floppy. There may be better ways to do this, but it was my first experience with an edging like this.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>: I really like the changes I made, but I&#8217;m not sure they&#8217;re enough. I love the way it&#8217;s fitted through the bust and at the waist, but after that it flares and flares and flares, which I just don&#8217;t think is a great look for me. If I&#8217;d been able to add a few inches of fairly straight knitting, maybe another diamond&#8217;s worth (and I&#8217;m honestly tempted to make another version in which I do that) and then the flare would be down sort of camouflaging my thighs rather than uncomfortably close to my waist. I&#8217;m getting better at figuring out what sort of things I should wear, but maybe how to wear them is a bit beyond me. My sweater currently retracts to about 22 inches in length, which is shorter than suggested in the pattern. I&#8217;m hoping I can block it aggressively to get out the few extra inches I want. I just have very springy yarn and I&#8217;d hoped all the weight at the bottom would hold it down more. I&#8217;m frustrated by the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brododaktula/315208548/">how excessive the bottom flare can be</a> but I still love the sweater and what I did with it. I&#8217;m hoping blocking will move me into total swooning territory, but I&#8217;m proud and it&#8217;s warm and perhaps that&#8217;s enough. Or maybe I&#8217;ll learn from my mistakes and make a second, which could be a lot of fun!

<p>Thanks to you, O commenter: we will take these words of wisdom to heart.</p>
<p>Except&#8230;. This comment arrives, fortuitously, soon after I complained about <a href="../../archives/2006/03/02/ummmm">excessive attention to universal themes in <cite class="Movies">Brokeback Mountain</cite></a>. The exhortation to <i>just live</i> suggests that we ought to pay more attention to our universal, shared experience of life and not worry so much about differences&#8212;don&#8217;t live in some other person&#8217;s skin for a day, but consider what you share with that other person. Good advice. Exclusive attention to differences leads at best to alienation and lack of empathy and at worst to hatred and oppression: racism, sexism, homophobia. But exclusive attention to universal or shared experience and ignorance of difference leads to the subtler oppression of whitewashing. By living in some other person&#8217;s skin for a day, figuratively or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Like_Me">literally</a>, we may find and celebrate the diversities and the universalities of our lives. &#8220;I am Curious (Black)!&#8221; for all its clumsy preaching, makes this worthwhile point.

<p>Ah, not blogging is fun. Maybe blogging can be fun too?</p>
<p>Um, but what to blog about? Rose and I saw <cite class="Movies">Brokeback Mountain</cite> a few days ago. <cite class="People">Jake Gyllenhaal</cite> and <cite class="People">Heath Ledger</cite> are so brave! Fah.</p>
<p>I was going to mention how it&#8217;s not exactly a universal love story, since people whose love doesn&#8217;t deviate from normative restrictions aren&#8217;t encouraged to fear and despise themselves, aren&#8217;t murdered for the crime of existing or driven into a traumatized unlife in the closet. Then I read the <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18712"><cite class="Magazines">New York Review of Books</cite> review</a>, so I&#8217;ll just link to that instead. Because I&#8217;m lazy.</p>
<p>I will say this: universality is overrated. Universal themes: who cares? They&#8217;re generic, we&#8217;ve seen them a million times before. The specificity is what makes stories worth reading! And the specificity is especially important in <cite>Brokeback Mountain</cite>, where <a href="http://www.godhatesfags.com/">the specific story is real and happening right now</a>. There are people&#8212;maybe not as many as there used to be, but still far too many&#8212;who would watch <cite>Brokeback Mountain</cite> and rejoice in Jack and Ennis&#8217;s misery. (They&#8217;d probably be sad about the broken marriages, though.) There are many men who won&#8217;t see the movie because they fear the image of gay sex. That&#8217;s what the story&#8217;s about: denial, hatred and fear of sexuality, a man who can&#8217;t overcome his fear and kills his own soul as thoroughly as other fearful men kill his would-be lover.</p>
<p>I just thought of something. Did anybody praise <cite class="People">Liam Neeson</cite> and <cite class="People">Peter Sarsgaard</cite> for playing bisexual in <cite class="Movies">Kinsey</cite>?</p>

I was gonna say the little girls are being denied their veiled bondage quasi-porn, but it occurred to me they they must be getting <em>plenty</em> of that in their manga.</p>

<div class="text">
<p>Since I did a health update last time, I&#8217;ll add now that apparently the reason I&#8217;ve felt yucky the whole last month is pneumonia, but I&#8217;m on a new antibiotic that seems to be turning things around. Still, expect a certain amount of radio silence.</p>
<p>We did go see <cite class="Movies">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</cite> a week or two ago. <cite class="People">Steven</cite> had read the books in middle school or so, but I got to them much earlier, which I think is why they stuck so deep in me. In kindergarten, I could recite full pages from <cite class="People">C.S. Lewis</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Books">The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</cite> because I spent so much time poring over it and making sure my pictures of Mr. Tumnus and Lucy matched the descriptions. I&#8217;ve probably read it and my very favorite, <cite class="Books">The Voyage of The Dawn Treader</cite> 50+ times, if not far more than that. But I hadn&#8217;t read them recently, not since middle school or so for me, when I moved from believing that even if I Jesus made no sense to me I could understand the power of Aslan to deciding that it was all just stories and I was ready to read something new.  After the movie, though, I decided to give them another shot. I was reading a book a night last week (in publication chronology) but I seem to have tapered off after <cite class="Books">The Silver Chair</cite>, since I know in my old opinion it was all downhill from there, especially into <cite class="Books">The Last Battle</cite>. </p>
<p>See, that&#8217;s where the gender problems get inescapable, or so it seemed to me. The Pevensie children are thrust into Narnia again because they&#8217;re dying on earth, but sister Susan is no longer with them. See, she&#8217;s now more interested in boys and stockings and lipstick than in the Narnian ideals of righteousness and stuff. (Here and throughout quotes are paraphrased, but correct to the best of my memory. Again, I plead sick and don&#8217;t want to have to flip through all those pages.) Apparently so much for &#8220;once a king or queen in Narnia, always a king or queen in Narnia&#8221; when it comes to getting one last chance! I think it especially bothered me because in the setup to <cite>Dawn Treader</cite> it&#8217;s explained that Susan gets to accompany their parents to America because she&#8217;s pretty and not as smart as the other children and thus will gain more from the experience. See, that always bothered me. Shouldn&#8217;t Aslan grade on a curve if this is what we already know Susan&#8217;s like? That&#8217;s all the explanation there is, though, and that always nagged at me even though I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve ever cared about lipstick or stockings or boys. </p>
<p>Nothing before that seemed too bad, though it was there. Father Christmas tells the girls in the first book that wars are ugly when women fight. Then there&#8217;s Eustace&#8217;s teetotaler, vegetarian parents in <cite>Dawn Treader</cite>, with his mother particularly singled out for being disappointed when he comes back from Narnia, where he&#8217;s had life-changing experiences, because now he&#8217;s just like an ordinary boy. In the ridiculous liberal parody school, Experiment House, that Jill and Eustace attend in <cite class="Books">The Silver Chair</cite>, the head of schools who allows bullying to go on in order to study bullies turns out in the last pages to be (<i>gasp!</i>) a woman, although she&#8217;s eventually shuffled off to Parliament where she won&#8217;t have any more negative effects on anyone. Maybe it&#8217;s because these books have been part of my life since before I could read that this comes across as more a cranky old uncle-figure complaining about kids (and schools) these days. I didn&#8217;t agree, but I found it easier to ignore those bits and focus on the parts I found less off-putting.</p>
<p>What I did find more off-putting was the way the movie dealt with such issues. This is very much Lucy&#8217;s story and there&#8217;s a reason, in Lewis&#8217;s rigid gender system, that this is a book dedicated to a young girl. It&#8217;s not really about the epic battle sequences, although I may just be saying this because they do nothing for me. More important are the personal transformations the children all go through in their adventure, and unfortunately if you&#8217;re going to have exciting times hiding from the wolves, you don&#8217;t have time for all that. It just seemed unbalanced to me, in a story about children thrown into a situation where they have to become adults, to depict this almost purely by how nobly they toss their heads when sparring or doing archery practice. And that&#8217;s not even mentioning the things the movie added. Now Mr. and Mrs. Beaver suddenly play out the smart mom/doofus dad dynamic common in bad sitcoms, and I don&#8217;t think talking animals had to be funny in quite the modern way they were. I don&#8217;t think the Susan/Peter dynamic was expressed well enough in the movie, either; they weren&#8217;t trying to be mom and dad, just to be leaders to the other children as best they could and with varying ideas about what would be best. Father Christmas&#8217;s line about why he doesn&#8217;t want Lucy and Susan to fight unless they absolutely must gets cleaned up, but then Peter forces Edmund to wear a woman&#8217;s coat, because nothing&#8217;s more humiliating than being like a <i>girl</i>! Ah, how times have changed in these 60 years!</p>
<p>This is all leaving aside the question of whether there&#8217;s a crypto-Christian story playing, which is certainly what Christian groups are being told. I&#8217;m not so sure. Yeah, Aslan sacrifices himself and then shows up again, but I think there&#8217;s more to Jesus than that. What we don&#8217;t hear until the very end of the movie is the refrain that runs through the book, <em>Aslan is not a tame lion</em>. The actors did their best to portray the awesomeness (in both the grand and terrifying sense) of the Great Lion, but the movie didn&#8217;t really bother with that. Weirder still is that only Aslan has to make meaningful sacrifices, and all his scarier moments are removed so that he can look better gilded. In one of my favorite scenes in the book, Lucy comes upon her dying brother Edmund as the battle is winding down and she gives him a drop of her healing fire flower potion. For a long, dreadful moment, nothing happens. Then Aslan tells her that she needs to move on to others, and she basically shushes him. He points out (loudly) that others may be dying because of her selfishness and at that she leaps up apologetically and heads out on her task. Edmund&#8217;s stern talking-to when he&#8217;s returned to Aslan&#8217;s camp is fiercer, too, as is the admonition that Peter needs to clean his sword. Maybe there are a lot of Christians who think that individuals don&#8217;t matter in the face of a god whose sacrifice has changed everything, but I&#8217;m pretty sure most of them go in for the &#8220;doing good works&#8221; side of things too. That&#8217;s the part, not the deeper magic from before the dawn of time, that seems compelling to me as a reader, though not as a viewer since it&#8217;s hardly anywhere to be seen.</p>
<p>I complained a little about the battle already and I&#8217;m sure in the post-<cite class="Movies">Lord of the Rings</cite> era we&#8217;re going to get many such showdowns, but this one struck me as almost dull. Again, it&#8217;s partly because the girls are absent. In the book, it&#8217;s the battle that&#8217;s left in the background (a sign that Lewis/Aslan now trust Edmund and Peter to play their roles without oversight?) with the waking of the statues as the key plot point. I loved the scene with Giant Rumblebuffin (not in the least because it brings back Lucy&#8217;s handkerchief a third time) and the little Christmas diners and the moment when Lucy finds the stone Mr. Tumnus in a niche upstairs and the other lion who leaps around telling everyone about his brotherhood with Aslan, who speaks of &#8220;us lions.&#8221; This is drama! This is weeping giants and a reminder that a battle isn&#8217;t decided only by those on the front lines (again, I think, a nod toward the Christians). Instead what we got were vaguely realistic falling rocks and charging polar bears, which I&#8217;m sure thrilled and excited plenty of viewers but seemed to me to be missing something. As becomes clearer in later books, part of what makes Narnia special is the talking animals, the naiads and dryads and so on. Should the moment of Narnian glory really be represented as one long beastly roar? Sure, we need to see Edmund go for the Witch&#8217;s wand rather than her head, but I really don&#8217;t care about in what order the centaurs went forth, and the archers and so on.</p>
<p>Then there was the Witch herself, who seemed to me pure sex almost to the point of overkill. She seemed scary because she was so weird, not because she was cold and dangerous. Sure, she would have killed Edmund, but even the moment she slaughters Aslan didn&#8217;t seem as intense and final as I thought it should have been. There wasn&#8217;t really the primal darkness I wanted to see, just the sense that she had an army of clones without personalities behind her willing to heed her every command. Maybe that&#8217;s a place where no movie could touch imagination, but it seemed the onset of spring melted her too instead of leaving her flushed with fury and desperate power.</p>
<p>This is not to say I didn&#8217;t enjoy the movie. I thought it was a lot of fun, and the 6 or so children sitting behind us (much quieter than their parents) seemed to enjoy it too. I told Steven just before the movie started, &#8220;Knit bloggers are trying to figure out how to make Lucy&#8217;s sweater, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll want to do that.&#8221; I was so, so wrong.

<p>Well, it had to happen someday. Someone&#8217;s finally <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/elayneriggs/112104724918777598/#220514">asked about the existence of women comic book bloggers</a>. And while the obvious response is that they&#8217;re all over <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a>, <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/elayneriggs/112104724918777598/#220515"><cite class="People">Elayne Riggs</cite></a> and <a href="http://realtegan.blogspot.com/#112110794007430555"><cite class="People">Laura Gjovaag</cite></a> only name seven, including themselves. I had no trouble coming up with 20 non-pros off the top of my head, but maybe that just means I&#8217;ve been paying more attention to the issue. It&#8217;s not a community, certainly, but it&#8217;s not nothing and we&#8217;re not all invisible.</p>
<p>Where am I going with this? Nowhere directly, but it coincided with the <a href="http://comicbookgalaxy.com/sethreport_071105.html">first post by a woman</a> at the new <a href="http://comicbookgalaxy.com/">Comic Book Galaxy</a>, although author <cite class="People">Diana Tamblyn</cite> still isn&#8217;t listed among the <a href="http://comicbookgalaxy.com/staff.html"> official contributors</a>. I wasn&#8217;t surprised to see that the new direction CBG would be taking included lots of writing from lots of white guys, but it was interesting to note that (by my count) 12 of the 25 contributors are also bloggers.</p>
<p>Before I go any farther, I&#8217;ll note that I was not one of the women <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/cro2/111972463355937181/#114811">approached by CBG to contribute</a> and I have absolutely no interest in being involved with them anyway. What&#8217;s interesting to me is that so many other bloggers feel differently. I understand that many comics bloggers really want to break into comics writing and that there are already plenty of bloggers writing weekly columns (and arguably some of the best ones) for a wide variety of comics sites. I&#8217;m perfectly happy to write here and do nothing else because I get to set the rules and the parameters (in my case, in collaboration with <cite class="People">Steven</cite>) and then write whatever I want to write. I gave up my dreams of writing professionally a decade ago, so this current setup is pretty much my ideal. So what is it that makes some of these new blogger/columnists consider <a href="http://brillbuilding.blogspot.com/2005/06/ive-been-blogging-for-one-year-now.html">shifting to a wider pop culture focus</a> or <a href="http://johnnybacardi.blogspot.com/2005/06/hello-just-wanted-to-let-you-know-that.html">confining comics reviews to CBG</a>? I don&#8217;t really know beyond what they say there and I&#8217;d love to hear more because I&#8217;ve always been fascinated in why people write the way they do on blogs and what they think they&#8217;re doing with their blogs in the first place. But what do they think they&#8217;re doing with their columns and how do those replace or supplement their blogs? </p>
<p>And here&#8217;s where things get ugly or controversial, and I&#8217;m just going to say what I think with the caveat (which I hope would be obvious to all readers anyway) that obviously this is just what I think and I have no vested interest in whether or not others agree or want to implement my ideas. There&#8217;s no good reason I should matter to you, right? I think if <a href="http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/blog/2005/06/monday-briefing-special-edition-new.html">CBG were a teaching hospital</a>, I wouldn&#8217;t go in for surgery there. It&#8217;s a site that requires <a href="http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/blog/2005/07/tuesday-briefing-you-know-between-you.html">copious editing</a>, and yet not all the punctuation ends up where it belongs. Sure, it&#8217;s a work in progress, but it&#8217;s not the second coming of anything. I have a reputation for despairing that there&#8217;s not more good writing in comics, a complaint that extends to comics criticism. While there aren&#8217;t many CBG columns I think are really badly written, I&#8217;m not getting excited either, not hearing new voices, just some guys on the internet.  And the real, core problem is that they&#8217;re writing as if they&#8217;re not on the internet. This is a site that has <a href="http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/crackshots_001.html">three</a> different <a href="http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/breakdowns_403.html">columns</a> analyzing and <a href="http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/review_062805_icehaven.html">reviewing</a> <cite class="Comics">Ice Haven</cite> in the same week with not only no conversation between them but no links from one piece to another. In fact, if I hadn&#8217;t made those links for you, you&#8217;d be stuck doing what I did and puzzling through the <a href="http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/commentary.html">commentary listing</a> to try to find where the two that aren&#8217;t listed might have been. This is a comics site that talks about comics but not in a way that makes discussions readily available to a casual reader. The google search is effective but inelegant, to say the least.</p>
<p>Why give up the conversational possibilities of a blog for a closed system like this? Why write something online if it might as well be mimeographed? Why have three overlapping reviews and nothing synthesizing them, analyzing the connections and dissonances (and nothing to help readers do this for themselves)? And I realize that none of these CBG bloggers have closed up shop and I really don&#8217;t expect them to. I&#8217;m sure it brings them more prominence than their individual endeavors would and it must be great writing experience to be expected to deliver the same sort of writing on a regular basis (which is yet another reason this would not be the job for me!) and I don&#8217;t think these blogger/columnists have made a bad decision in getting involved here. I do think it&#8217;s a bad idea to think that this version of CBG is the apotheosis of anything.  But I&#8217;m not the whole audience, though I&#8217;m a reader, and it doesn&#8217;t need to appeal to what I think it should be.</p>
<p>But for those keeping score at home, I think it should be more like a blog than a webzine with near-daily updates. It could be an active conversation between all these informed and verbal columnists engaging each other&#8217;s ideas rather than writing in a vacuum for an audience in the ether. It could be easily navigable with a link for the title of each referenced comic or creator connecting to any other uses of those names on the site. In short, it could be intertextual in a way that it&#8217;s not, and I think that lack is its greatest limitation. It&#8217;s not a galaxy with any constellations in it, just a collection of loose stars. And sure, constellations are in part the stories we attach to groups of stars, but it&#8217;s a lot of work for a reader to create those stories right now and there&#8217;s no way to see whether what I call the Big Dipper is someone else&#8217;s Great Bear. </p>
<p>Of course I think it would be good if there were more women writing for CBG if they wanted to and had things they wanted to say, but I also know that there are already women writing for readers who are willing to look and pay attention. We don&#8217;t all have the same interests or tastes in comics or in blogging and I wouldn&#8217;t expect a woman at CBG to speak for me just because we have ovaries, but I&#8217;d be interested to see what she&#8217;d say just as I&#8217;m interested enough to read women bloggers who are writing now. But if there are other women who don&#8217;t want to be part of the move to <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/cro2/111972463355937181/#115197">&#8220;put more &#8216;gal&#8217; into the Galaxy soon&#8221;</a> (especially given the way contributing editor <cite class="People">Chris Allen</cite> <a href="http://www.chrisallenonline.com/2005/06/king-of-all-breasts.html">discusses</a>, <a href="http://www.chrisallenonline.com/2005/06/congraduations.html"> views</a> and <a href="http://www.chrisallenonline.com/2005/06/trojan-hearse.html">interacts</a>  with real-life women) I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a problem at all. I&#8217;m just glad there are other venues where their voices can be heard, and I prefer those anyway.

<div class="text">
<p>I&#8217;ve been hoping to post something substantive but now that I&#8217;m peering out from under the edge of a multi-day migraine, I&#8217;ll be shuffling back to bed as soon as I can. So instead of substance, I can give vague impressions.</p>
<p><cite class="People">Greg Burgas</cite> had <a href="http://goodcomics.blogspot.com/2005/06/my-god-my-god-why-have-comic-book.html">some thoughts about why you don&#8217;t see more Christians in superhero comics</a> (one of the answers being because you don&#8217;t look hard enough) and while I didn&#8217;t think there was too much going on there beyond the anecdote-swapping, it reminded me that I had written about <a href="../../archives/2005/02/15/veils/index.html">portrayals of Muslim women in mainstream comics</a> a few months ago. Both posts have plenty of activity in the comments, too, if you&#8217;re not about to retreat to bed and are looking to kill some time reading.</p>
<p>Since I wrote that in February, <cite class="Comics">Vimanarama</cite> has ended, and I should really update my thoughts on how it dealt with faith in both religious and secular or personal terms. I found it both satisfying and disappointing; a three-issue story is seldom enough for me these days. I&#8217;m not sure I have much more to say now. However, there clearly is more to say about Dust of <cite class="Comics">New X-Men</cite>, a book I&#8217;m not currently reading in either its <cite class="Comics">Hellions</cite> miniseries or <cite class="Comics">Mutant Academy X</cite> formats. <cite class="People">Steven</cite> went to buy comics today and returned to tell me I absolutely had to look at <a href="http://marvel.com/comics/onsale/covers/0605/NEWXHEL002_COV.jpg">the cover of <cite>Hellions</cite> #2</a>, but he didn&#8217;t buy us a copy. Apparently the premise is that in this issue Dust has the option of making one wish that can change her life forever, and I&#8217;m not sure what to make of the suggestions the cover implies. I&#8217;m tempted now to buy the miniseries just to find out what&#8217;s going on with her, whether she now considers her modesty a confining limitation or whether the artist can only conceive of Muslim women as seductive harem girls in the Orientalist tradition (and I hope not, since he&#8217;s the interior artist as well) or really what&#8217;s going on here. I was interested in her story because I like teenage stories about body issues, especially on feminist terms. I&#8217;m interested in smart analysis of the contrary pulls to living in an attractive body versus being just one of the guys or a brain in a vat, what it means to be taken seriously as a person and a woman. On the off chance that this is what&#8217;s going on here, I may well have a look.</p>
<p>I thought I had more to say, but if I can&#8217;t remember, that must mean it&#8217;s time to quit.

<div class="text">
<p>I&#8217;m still on the injured list, with my right arm sort of swollen and sore from today&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCV">NCV</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography">EMG</a>, but when I couldn&#8217;t sleep last night I read <cite class="Comics">Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</cite>, the second volume in <cite class="People">Bryan Lee O&#8217;Malley</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Comics">Scott Pilgrim</cite> series and because this was a gift from the author, I feel compelled to write something lousy about a fun book in hopes that I&#8217;ll feel more inclined to say something fun later. I read it twice and noticed all sorts of interesting connections on my second time through, so I&#8217;m hoping I&#8217;ll have a second post about some of those later this week.</p>
<p>And this is indeed a fun book. It picks up with the craziness from the end of <cite class="Comics">Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s Precious Little Life</cite> and just gets crazier. Ramona can still show up in Scott&#8217;s dreams (and seriously, that would be the end of the relationship for me; I&#8217;m surprised I can comfortably share an apartment with <cite class="People">Steven</cite>, but he manages to get around my privacy barriers) and there are other dreamers too and more video-game action, not to mention melodramatic coincidences and moments of realization. We get some background on Scott&#8217;s high school days, a secret origin of sorts. And when I talked last year about <a href="../../archives/2004/08/22/rating-awesome/index.html">how the first volume made me regain some faith in comics</a>, this year and this volume have brought me back to and beyond superheroes. I know I&#8217;ve argued before that even <a href="../../archives/2004/02/04/joan-of-arcadia-alternative-superhero/index.html"><cite class="Television">Joan of Arcadia</cite> is a story about superheroes</a>, and I&#8217;m realizing that I defended superhero comics in the past for things they could do well, but I appreciate those things even more when they&#8217;re done without spandex or breast implants.  And that&#8217;s just what&#8217;s going on in Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s life, from fighting to costume and hairstyle changes to interpersonal drama, superhero stuff. </p>
<p>The reason I like superhero stories is because they have so little to do with the smashing and stomping that are supposed to be at their core, at least if done correctly. Instead they&#8217;re a heavy template for readers to fit themselves into a reality where certain narratives make sense and the readers can make sense of themselves. It&#8217;s not about the power fantasy but about both power and fantasy, which is something over-specific &#8220;slice of life&#8221; stories can miss.  In slicing skewed lives from a slightly off reality, <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite> manages to avoid being a dullsville story about an endearingly scatter-brained slacker who can&#8217;t bother to get a job or commit to a real and healthy relationship by instead being a story that blows up the drama of the mundane so that it looks the way it feels. Scott&#8217;s heartbroken ex-girlfriend Knives Chau (17 years old!) doesn&#8217;t just get a new look to feel better about herself post-breakup but makes herself an obsessed avenging angel able to play out the fantasies many feel after a first rejection. Sitting on a rug eating garlic bread is a t????te-????-t????te dinner more romantic than a more traditional setup. Casual contact from a lost love can leave even a hero decimated. Romantic mistakes characters make play out in their lives again and again like the returns of villains who in a more standard superhero story would be burly guys or femmes fatales rather than plain old bad habits and bad choices and things going around and coming around. </p>
<p>And honestly I was a tiny bit worried about what direction this book would take, although I expected the humor and the lovely art. I don&#8217;t like stalker romances; they&#8217;re creepy in general and hit too close to home. And yet Scott&#8217;s relationship with Ramona is able to blossom into something real because the world around it, the league of evil ex-boyfriends, is so unrealistic that &#8220;normal&#8221; reactions or behaviors don&#8217;t enter into it at all and none of this bothers me. It&#8217;s the romantic version of cartoon violence, although the pain is palpable (and so is the thrill). But love is scarily full of possibilities, and I did basically love <cite>Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s Precious Little Life</cite>. But I enjoyed its successor, too, and I remain charmed and excited. Last night I would have told you that I still prefer the first book, the mixture of inanity and wackiness, but tonight I was leaning toward the second. It may just be that I can&#8217;t really choose or separate them.  And maybe on a larger scale separation just isn&#8217;t the point. Dreams and video games and real life are hopelessly muddled in this tale, as big bosses steal girls and vanquished foes leave only coins behind them.  One thing flows into another, and while there&#8217;s some game physics going on, it&#8217;s not really clear if this is dream logic or life logic underlying the emotional narrative. I&#8217;m certainly still a fan, a Scottaholic as my little pal Knives would say, and If I can&#8217;t sleep tonight I&#8217;ll be reading again (though really I&#8217;d rather be dreaming myself).

<p>I can&#8217;t stay gone because I can&#8217;t stand to stay silent right now. <a href="http://www.mangalife.com/">Manga Life</a> is a site from the folks who brought you <a href="http://www.silverbulletcomics.com/">Silver Bullet Comics</a>: &#8220;Our aim is to guide you through the masses of manga appearing on the shelves of your book store, to pick out THE essential books to own.&#8221; While it was <cite class="People">Johanna Draper Carlson</cite> who <a href="http://www.comicsworthreading.com/blog/2005/05/new-manga-site.html">brought this to my attention</a>, their <a href="http://www.mangalife.com/reviews/FromEroicawithLovev1.htm">review of <cite class="Comics">From Eroica with Love</cite></a> deserves a close read. I realize that comics journalism on the internet is pretty dire and assume that there is little editorial oversight anywhere, but apparently the SBC/ML crew are okay with statements like &#8220;[homosexuality]  is a gender, not a &#8216;Lifestyle choice&#8217;&#8221; and &#8220;[the male characters] look like women in drag! &#8221; (since I&#8217;m assuming the author, <cite class="People">Michael Deeley</cite>, doesn&#8217;t mean they do, in fact, resemble women in drag, who could pass as men) being prominently displayed in their reviews. I mention this because his input alone is enough to make me want to avoid the site. But I&#8217;m not just offended by the total lack of empathy or tact (&#8221;Also, the gay love scenes made me cringe. I????????m open-minded; not open-bodied.&#8221;) but by the fact that this is just horribly written. I don&#8217;t want to hear from an editor about how they&#8217;ll do better in the future; the present matters and it&#8217;s awfully grim.</p>
<p>Enough. I just wanted to pause a moment and go back to that (sort of) to boil things down to the most generic level and say that, basically, people have sexes (biological/genetic), genders (cultural expressions of masculinity/femininity), and sexual orientations (straight/gay/bisexual) with several other options that could be tossed into each of my parentheticals. Anyone who can&#8217;t handle this level of terminology probably shouldn&#8217;t be talking about any of this.</p>
<p>And have you guessed yet where I&#8217;m going with this? Maybe, if you saw that I already sputtered about this <a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/jjakala/messages?msg=921.90">this morning</a>, but here I go again. I&#8217;m a big proponent of conversation, communication, mutual understanding, which I hope would be clear to anyone who&#8217;s been reading this blog for any length of time. I think that at some fundamental level we do end up with Roman Jakobsen/<cite class="People">James Smith</cite>-style <a href="http://www.jamesmith.org/sugarmagnetic/?p=103">mutual untranslatability</a> where each of us uses language in a unique enough way that to some extent we can&#8217;t fully speak to one another. And so if I were <cite class="People">James Meeley</cite>, I would never have assumed that &#8220;explor[ing] the kids&#8217; identities &#8212; sexual and otherwise &#8211;&#8221; meant to everyone what it means to me. In fact, I know it doesn&#8217;t, since to me exploring a sexual identity means trying to figure out what sort of people you find attractive, dealing with fluttery yearnings and awkward kisses and awkward suitors and unrequited affection. And sure, at some point, sexual activity probably comes into the picture, but it&#8217;s by no means the core. And so my first objection to Meeley&#8217;s <a href="http://thecomicasylum.blogspot.com/2005/04/when-blog-goes-silent-whys-and.html">first objection to the aforementioned trend in <cite class="Comics">Young Avengers</cite></a> is that the simplest response would be to clarify the terms, not draw up battle lines. But that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not the sort of person who sends offended letters to comics publishers, I suppose.</p>
<p>My second and more important objection to both that and his <a href="http://thecomicasylum.blogspot.com/2005/05/to-speak-perchance-to-hear.html">second objection</a> is that if he wants to convince everyone there&#8217;s no homophobia here, I&#8217;d like to see a little logic. Meeley&#8217;s complaint is about alleged future sexual content in an &#8220;all-ages&#8221; title. I see no point in disputing about what the future may hold, but you just can&#8217;t argue that this is an all-ages title.  It&#8217;s quite clearly labeled <a href="http://www.marvel.com/catalog/ratings.htm">PSR</a>, which as a retailer of sorts is something he should understand means this is material suitable for 12-year-olds and older readers. While this is what Marvel used to call PG back when they were stealing terms from the MPAA, but clearly it&#8217;s more equivalent to their PG-13 rating. And what does PG-13 mean? It means that parents are strongly cautioned that some material may be inappropriate for kids under the age of 13. Marvel&#8217;s PSR is appropriate for most ages but parents should review it before or with young (presumably sub-12) children. Whether or not Meeley thinks this should be an all-ages book has no bearing on its status in reality. (Both Marvel and the MPAA share what I consider a disturbing tendency to let kids see tons and tons of violence per rating level, but that doesn&#8217;t really factor into this argument, thank goodness.)</p>
<p>My brother is 13 and I&#8217;d have no qualms about letting him read <cite>Young Avengers</cite>. I differ from James Meeley in that I would still lend him my copy if there was some gay romance, although I&#8217;m still not sure what this &#8220;sexual exploration&#8221; that so frightens him entails. And I suppose I&#8217;d let him watch PG-13 movies and have in fact taken him to a few myself. One I haven&#8217;t taken him to see but enjoy a lot myself is <cite class="Movies">Saved</cite>, which I think could teach us a thing or two about the PG-13 rating (and, by extension, what sort of material is appropriate for the 12-and-up crew who are the explicit target audience for <cite>Young Avengers</cite>). In <cite>Saved</cite>, Mary is a student at a Christian high school whose classmate and boyfriend confesses to her that he thinks he&#8217;s gay. She decides to have sex with him (on screen, though with tasteful editing) to try to encourage a conversion experience that will make him straight. The experiment is a failure: he gets sent to a &#8220;recovery&#8221; program and she ends up pregnant. The rest of the film deals with these high school students (I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m old enough yet to call them &#8220;kids&#8221;) exploring their identities &#8212; &#8220;sexual and otherwise.&#8221; This means everything from Mary&#8217;s sex with Dean to her later shy flirting with new student Patrick to her super-Christian friend Hillary Faye&#8217;s ends-justify-the-means attempt to draw attention to a topic she cares about to Cassandra&#8217;s ups and downs as a Jew at a Christian school and <em>her</em> boyfriend Roland&#8217;s experiences as a paraplegic. Because it&#8217;s a PG-13 movie set in a Christian high school, there&#8217;s not a lot of profanity, though Mary says &#8220;fuck!&#8221; after finding out she&#8217;s pregnant. In PG-13 movies, apparently, you can get away with one non-verbal &#8220;fuck&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t refer to a sex act.  I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s not true even of PSR+ books at Marvel. Would I have taken my brother to see it? Probably not, because he&#8217;s young for his age and still sort of disgusted by kissing and also because my parents&#8217; views and mine differ on religion and I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily want to get into that with him or upset them just because of a movie. But I&#8217;ve lent it to the brothers older than him and wouldn&#8217;t mind at all if he wanted to borrow it in a year or two when he&#8217;s ready for that sort of story.</p>
<p>Where am I going with this? Nowhere, really, because Meeley&#8217;s response when <cite class="People">David Welsh</cite> posed the question of ratings to him this morning was just to say that <cite>Young Avengers</cite> <em>ought</em> to be all-ages. It&#8217;s not entirely clear whether this is a &#8220;some imaginary world, like, in my head&#8221; kind of response or that he simply wishes there were more all-ages comics or that he&#8217;s seen the recent darkening of the Marvel and DC universes and plans to rage against the dying of the light. The facts are that <cite>Young Avengers</cite> isn&#8217;t an all-ages title and doesn&#8217;t have any homosexual content. I don&#8217;t see why there&#8217;s any reason for it to be a last stand in the culture wars. By all means, it&#8217;s fine to write to Marvel to ask them to bring back Bucky or keep queers out of the limelight or aim for a no-prize in explaining what&#8217;s really up with The Scarlet Witch, but I hope no one doing this would be surprised when the response isn&#8217;t total concession from the publisher. Maybe as a woman and a feminist and someone well outside the target audience I&#8217;m just used to the idea that my preferences won&#8217;t be heard or reflected in most superhero comics, but I would hope that&#8217;s a more universal response.</p>
<p>And as usual, I don&#8217;t like the idea that comics need to be for kids. I wish there were more comics for smart people of many different ages, and it&#8217;s that lack that I&#8217;m feeling most acutely now. <cite>Young Avengers</cite> could perhaps be just such a title, a book young teens could read about the perils and excitement of being a teen writ large. I doubt it will be, but unlike some people I&#8217;m willing to hope. And I&#8217;m willing to say my piece and go away from things that don&#8217;t appeal to me, so this should be the last you hear from me about Manga Life unless things change drastically. But I think it&#8217;s worth having a conversation rather than sermonizing, don&#8217;t you?

<div class="text">
<p>This time <a href="http://ringwood.blogspot.com/2005/04/cuz-im-not-wincing-alone.html">Ken set me off</a> (you guys do know it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.femdefence.info/bakgr2.html">conceptual art</a>, right?) but this is a post I&#8217;ve wanted to write or maybe a better way to say it is felt I ought to write about once a week since at least last summer. I know I&#8217;ve asked before where all these rape jokes among comics bloggers come from, but what worries me more is where they&#8217;re going.</p>
<p>I was 17 when I was raped, not even a month into my first semester in college. I was <a href="http://notthebeastmaster.typepad.com/weblog/2005/02/practical_notes.html">Brilliant, Attractive Girl who seems a Bit of a Headcase</a>, though I was dangerously scrawny under my too-large clothes and had lopped off my hair to try to undermine or circumvent any potential attractiveness. And so I ended up helping a dormmate, an international student, proofread a paper he&#8217;d written. I wondered what he was doing at the school with the level of English he had, since clearly he couldn&#8217;t keep up with even the basics of his classes. I wondered what I was doing there when clearly I would fit in better if I had the money he did and, like him, spent much of it on beer. And when he pushed me to the ground, I didn&#8217;t call for help because I didn&#8217;t want it, didn&#8217;t want anyone to see me being debased, didn&#8217;t want any evidence of the most humiliating, horrifying moment of my life. I sobbed and had a panic attack instead so that he had to pry my spasming legs apart. I went back to my room still sobbing and stayed in bed a few days and crumpled those sweatpants, underwear, turtleneck in the bottom of my closet. I threw them away when I withdrew from school not long after, well before he was forced out for failing grades and drug infractions. I didn&#8217;t tell anyone until it was too late to do whatever could have been done. </p>
<p>I know that was a long time ago. I don&#8217;t cry about it much, didn&#8217;t even feel that gnawing ache when the season came around last year. I did my suffering already, a year I don&#8217;t remember spent depressed almost to the point of catatonia, relationships where I tried to destroy myself or let myself be destroyed. I went back to my college and did my time making reparations, working as an educator and crafting policy with the administration, supporting others, being a visible face as the out survivor on campus. I did my forgiving pretty early on because it seemed like the only tenable option to me. I can understand (sort of) how sad and powerless he must have been to think that preying on me could give him any satisfaction or status, because I was the only person around who was lower than he was. When I learned at 17 that he&#8217;d told the guys on his floor about it, I had a breakdown. Now I wonder if they pitied him too. </p>
<p>And that was a long time ago and I&#8217;m over it to the extent that I&#8217;ll ever be, healthy, happy, in love and loved. And so it&#8217;s not that I feel personally hurt when I read rape jokes or have to hear guys (guys, always guys) talking about the vengeance they would take if the women they love were assaulted. (And by no means do I want to minimize the extent to which men can be victims of sexual assault, especially as children. But I think a lot of the people who make jokes about prison rape <em>do</em>, because sex and power and masculinity are all tied up in a little package that doesn&#8217;t allow them to think of themselves as ever being at risk or unsafe.) I don&#8217;t feel hurt but just annoyed, because I know when you talk like that you&#8217;re not talking to me. Because I know what it&#8217;s like, or know what it was like for myself to suffer at least and have heard others&#8217; stories, and I can&#8217;t make the same kinds of jokes. But at the same time I don&#8217;t think I should be forced to avoid the Fanboy Rampage comments section just because it&#8217;s pretty much guaranteed there will be someone else there who clearly thinks he can. I&#8217;m not asking for deference or even really an explanation, because I&#8217;ve never gotten one before. I&#8217;m just shocked or surprised or amazed that so many bloggers live in a world where people like me don&#8217;t exist or at least don&#8217;t read their blogs, where the constant references couldn&#8217;t be seen as hurtful. I think there&#8217;s a reason I never heard a female student say, &#8220;Oh, that test totally assraped me,&#8221; and it has something to do with the education sessions we&#8217;d do where everyone who knew someone who&#8217;d been sexually assaulted was asked to stand. While few freshman stood up, by senior year it seemed like nobody stayed seated. There&#8217;s some line between gallows humor and something that cuts too close or is just plain disrespectful, and I think that&#8217;s another reason I sometimes feel left out of the testosterone stew in these parts of the web. It just doesn&#8217;t compute.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t really know why I&#8217;m writing this except that I&#8217;m sick of having it in my head every time I do read all this casual rape-talk. I&#8217;m not trying to police anybody and I pick on Ken because I&#8217;ve talked to him about this a bit before and don&#8217;t think what I say will hurt his feelings; he likes to be inflammatory and, I think, sees rape jokes as one more extension of that. And that&#8217;s his decision and it shouldn&#8217;t have anything to do with me and won&#8217;t and doesn&#8217;t keep me from reading whatever he has to say. This isn&#8217;t a situation where first they came for the rape jokes and eventually all we could joke about were elephants jumping out of trees, or at least that&#8217;s not what I hope I&#8217;m saying. It&#8217;s more that I&#8217;m jealous of all these people who somehow have the option not to care about it, not to have that word jump out at them, to be able to use it casually and metaphorically. It&#8217;s not that I want to live that way as much as that I can&#8217;t and I&#8217;m amazed they can. The problem is the way those words self-select similar readers. I can handle them with only minor annoyance, but there are plenty of other people with personal stories much worse than mine who can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t or shouldn&#8217;t. And it bothers me that this sort of talk deliberately excludes them from any conversation it infects. But maybe there just aren&#8217;t a lot of rape survivors reading comics and comics blogs and maybe I&#8217;m completely overreacting. The problem is that none of us have any way to know for sure.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not that I think my fellow bloggers are misogynists who live in isolation, either. I think most of them who mention sexual assault, especially in this post-<cite class="Comics">Identity Crisis</cite> age do so because they think it&#8217;s worth reminding everyone of the extent to which it doesn&#8217;t belong in a sensical and healthy universe, but it&#8217;s easier to do it by joking about how the only way to have a blockbuster comics is on-panel sexual assault than it is to write an over-earnest post about why sexual assault is bad. So I realize I&#8217;m upsetting the balance by taking just that tack, but I figured this was worth saying and maybe now I won&#8217;t feel I need to say it anymore.

<div class="text">
<p>This post has been stagnating for over a week now. Other posts that wait unfinished for so long I just kill because I can&#8217;t pick up my thoughts well enough to keep going, but I&#8217;m hoping I can weave this together topically. See, I haven&#8217;t written here because I&#8217;ve been sick and I don&#8217;t know why. I had a flu a week (two weeks?) ago and have just been exhausted ever since. No fever, though I have more nightmares than usual, but I spent this weekend taking 3-hour naps and then wanting another one a few hours later. I&#8217;m just miserable and completely drained, which I&#8217;m sure has been a lot of fun for all the people who have to spend time with me, too.</p>
<p>At any rate, I stayed up a week ago Sunday reading <cite class="Comics">It&#8217;s a Bird&#8230;</cite>, <cite class="People">Steven Seagle</cite>&#8217;s fictionalized account of his personal crisis when offered a job writing Superman. It&#8217;s a physically beautiful volume, a comfortable size with fascinating art, but it was the story I&#8217;d wanted to read for a long time. In the story at least, Seagle&#8217;s family has a history of Huntington&#8217;s disease, and so his first tie to Superman is an issue of the comic he and his brother share in a hospital waiting room while the adults confer about his grandmother&#8217;s condition. Huntington&#8217;s is a family secret he hasn&#8217;t discussed with anyone growing up, something he was aware of without understanding at all, and the Superman gig and the news that his father has disappeared bring it to the surface.</p>
<p>Apparently Seagle (again, at least in the story; from here on out I&#8217;ll just treat &#8220;Seagle&#8221; as the fictional character since we have a <cite class="People">Steven</cite> on the site already, and I&#8217;ll deal with Seagle-the-author-guy as needed when he shows up) didn&#8217;t learn about Huntington&#8217;s when he took biology, which is strange because I know we covered it as early as 7th grade. I was 12 and I was obsessed, because it seemed like such perfect story material. While Seagle says it lacks a celebrity face, there&#8217;s <cite class="People">Woody Guthrie</cite>, whose frailty in his son&#8217;s movie <cite class="Movies">Alice&#8217;s Restaurant</cite>  apparently made quite an impression on viewers at the time, if my mother is to be believed. I mention this also because the parent/child relationship is at the core of the tragedy of Huntington&#8217;s, so while Woody&#8217;s decline is in some ways that of his generation (and Arlo&#8217;s drifting and trying to avoid the war is supposed to be characteristic of his decadent, passionate generation) it is also part of a story about what it means to be watching your father die young and painfully while your classmates are doing the same thing half a world away. Huntington&#8217;s, as I recall from my long-ago studies, is a real <cite class="People">O. Henry</cite> disease; by the time you realize you have it at age 40 or so, you&#8217;ve already passed it on to your children. It&#8217;s practically the only (certainly the only I know) major genetic disease that is dominant rather than recessive, which means that there are no carriers. Either you have it or you don&#8217;t. If one of your parents has it, there&#8217;s a 50 percent chance you will, too. </p>
<p>Seagle didn&#8217;t really play with that aspect of it, didn&#8217;t talk about the odds, which seemed, well, odd in a story in which he worries so much about his own chances. He doesn&#8217;t tell his girlfriend that there are genetic screenings available now (another messy, tough issue that would make good story fodder) perhaps because he doesn&#8217;t know, but also because this is the story of his myopically private anguish. And  really that&#8217;s what made it interesting. The book is comprised of vignettes, glimpses of Seagle with his girlfriend or with his editor or looking for his father or writing about Superman or the comics versions of the Superman stories he was writing. Seagle&#8217;s initial argument in wanting to turn down the Superman gig is that he has nothing to say about this invincible man, but he realizes that Superman works best as a foil for our flaws, as a way to safely understand the limits of our doomed bodies. <cite>It&#8217;s a Bird&#8230;</cite>, in addressing this head-on, is probably a more successful Superman story than most I&#8217;ve read, which isn&#8217;t saying much. It creates a sort of universal appeal because we all (I hope) worry occasionally or often about the secrets our genes and our families hold and what will happen when they get out.</p>
<p>Maybe I was just a receptive audience because I have to do a daily checkup on my mystery ailment to figure out whether things are getting worse (nope) or better (possibly today, I hope). Other people have to worry about cholesterol or tendencies toward cancers. And then there&#8217;s the history we know we hold, the times lately I&#8217;ve had to assess my ennui: is this normal stress and sadness or a return of the sort of depression from which there seems to be no escape? One part of what makes reading fun is that it&#8217;s a way to get out of my body a bit (when the books aren&#8217;t too heavy or my arms too tired) without pretending I don&#8217;t have one or that it has nothing to do with what&#8217;s going on in my head. </p>
<p>What was going on in my head as I read <cite>It&#8217;s a Bird&#8230;</cite> was initially disappointment that Seagle (author and character) didn&#8217;t seem to have more than superficial insights into Superman, that there were potentially some factual errors I don&#8217;t even remember anymore (I&#8217;m not sure about a connection between the Nazi-mandated Star of David and Superman&#8217;s outfit) but also hope that something more would come of this. It&#8217;s not as deep as what I would have wanted, but nothing much seems to be lately (and is this a symptom of laziness and overwork and intellectual stagnation on my part? I think so!) and I&#8217;m not the one who got to write it or even wanted to. It&#8217;s a beautiful book and a thoughtful one, a story about superheroes that strives for harmony, peace, a calmed self. For all that I enjoyed it and would have liked it even more if I&#8217;d waited until this week to buy it in paperback, but that&#8217;s not really an option. We do what we choose with the time that we&#8217;ve got, and if that means I occasionally buy a hardcover book at full price, so be it.  And now I&#8217;ll wind some yarn and rest.
