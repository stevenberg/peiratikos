<p>I just got back from taking my brother to an <a href="http://www.ataris.com">ataris</a> concert. OK, ey's old enough to take emself, but doesn't know the area and I need to get out more, so it worked out.  We got there late enough that we missed the first two opening bands, and the last I think consisted of robots following instructions from a random emo generator.   Their music was fine but completely uninspired.  And the singer just kept making me laugh.  Ey had two major delivery modes, crucifi(x/ct)ion and doubled-over-in-pain.  So either ey was a giant gamma hopping around on stage, or ey tossed emself dramatically, arms outstretched.  I have no idea whether the songs actually had anything to do with Jesus or anal sex.  Or cowboys, since ey was also really into microphone swinging.</p>

<p>And all this commentary takes me to my next point, that I'm an old fogey.  Although I knew a lot of people at the concert, more than I expected and a more diverse crew, the majority of the audience probably had a curfew and needed to worry about being up for the school bus.  I shouldn't mock this as I used to go there as a high school student, but it's disconcerting to see that most of the women present are thinner, younger, prettier or any combination thereof and yet it still doesn't bother me.  It just all seemed very cute.  I could remember when I was in high school and <i>my</i> friends were wearing CLASH t-shirts and I thought it was hopelessly silly.  It's even sillier to see 14- and 15-year-olds wearing them, all punked out.  I stood and enjoyed the concert alternating between nostalgia and patronizing smiles.</p>

<p>There were several songs both by the Ataris and a strange shirtless fellow who sang with them, perhaps attempting to channel Shane MacGowan, defining (ironically?) what is and isn't punk.  It made me glad my genres of choice avoid this.  It's especially good that I don't have to hear songs about absent fathers breeding absent fathers, though maybe you'd rather not be close to a dad who writes these sorts of songs.  I certainly wouldn't.  But then again, I'm not quite suburban and 80s nostalgic and hurt by childhood teasing to be emo.</p>

<p>And the Ataris were excellent. They were entirely in synch, lively and active and in control.  There wasn't much between-song banter, but the microphone barely picked up what there was.  I was impressed and enjoyed their set, maybe minus the audible lyrics of the Bad Dad song.  Though they'd apparently cancelled the two most recent shows on account of bronchitis, the lead singer seemed in good voice, and no one fell behind.  They did play a very short set and the audience was naive enough to be happily surprised when they returned for another.</p>

<p>I liked being out and despite not dancing or doing any of the things that make concerts fun for other people, really enjoyed myself.  The main band was enjoyable and I had a great time people watching. I  got to say hello to a few old friends and managed to hide from others.  I'm tempted to let this prompt a larger study of teenage dating habits.  There were tons of couples, by far mostly heterosexual.  What's most interesting is that fashion seemed to be most clearly defined for the males.  The women could wear whatever outlandish or totally mainstream things they wanted, but most of the men fell within a very clearly defined body type and clothing aesthetic.  While many of the women were above average weight, though far fewer than in the general populace, virtually none of the men were.  I'm intrigued, but I'm sure it's nothing I'll follow up.  Still, it was a fun evening and a nice change.</p>
