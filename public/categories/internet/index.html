<p>Like <a href="http://stevenberg.net/blog">Steven</a>, I&#8217;ve created my own solo (and probably non-comics) blog, <a href="http://surertonic.wordpress.com">surer tonic</a>. I should begin posting there more regularly in August.</p>
<p>This will be the end of Peiratikos and I&#8217;ll be closing all comment threads once I get through the comments currently in moderation to make sure nothing legitimate got nabbed by the spam catcher. I know Peiratikos has been dead for the last year or so, but when it was an active blog it helped me learn to be clearer about my thoughts (sometimes) and responsible for my opinions. I made some lasting friends and many more ephemeral ones whose opinions and comments still matter to me. I&#8217;m grateful to have been part of the early comics blogging community, and Steven and I both benefited from our early participation. Thanks to all who made this possible and pleasurable, especially <cite class="People">Steven</cite>. It was an interesting time and I&#8217;m a better person for having gone/grown through it.

<p>So I&#8217;m definitely not back to regular blogging&#8212;OK, I&#8217;ve never managed to blog very regularly, but anyway, I&#8217;m definitely not prepared even for monthly blogging at this point. We&#8217;ll have to see how it goes when my semester ends in a couple weeks. In the meantime, I&#8217;ve decided to join the world of <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html">Web 2.0</a> and start participating in <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/steven-berg/">Flickr</a> (see also <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/rose-and-steven/">the <strong>rose and steven</strong> group</a>) and <a href="http://del.icio.us/steven.berg">del.icio.us</a>. So far I&#8217;ve only uploaded <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/steven-berg/sets/72057594109610194/">the photos from our trip to New Orleans</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/steven-berg/sets/72057594110994714/">many photos of our pet cat</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>As long as I&#8217;m writing, I might as well write a little more. I think the only movie other than <a href="../../archives/2006/03/02/ummmm"><cite class="Movies">Brokeback Mountain</cite></a> that Rose and I have seen in a theater this year is <cite class="Movies">V for Vendetta</cite>. Oh, no, we also saw <cite class="Movies">Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story</cite>. I need to read <cite class="People">Laurence Sterne</cite>&#8217;s novel so I can understand how it works as an adaptation, but it works well standing alone too. As far as this kind of movie goes, I think it&#8217;s more frivolous than <cite class="Movies">8Â½</cite> and probably less frivolous than <cite class="Movies">Adaptation</cite>.</p>
<p>But <cite>V for Vendetta</cite>. We weren&#8217;t initially planning to see it, because it looked pretty stupid. But <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2006_03_01_archive.asp#114258572436494811"><cite class="People">William Gibson</cite> recommended it</a> and <a href="http://sweet-nothing.livejournal.com/"><cite class="People">John Pistelli</cite> at Maxims and Reflections</a> had a whole series of entertaining posts (<a href="http://sweet-nothing.livejournal.com/2842.html">&#8220;Ideas are Bulletproof,&#8221;</a> <a href="http://sweet-nothing.livejournal.com/3113.html">&#8220;Re-review,&#8221;</a> <a href="http://sweet-nothing.livejournal.com/3367.html">&#8220;Brands are Ideaproof,&#8221;</a> <a href="http://sweet-nothing.livejournal.com/4479.html">&#8220;A Shamanic Soldier Priest&#8221;</a> [tangentially related]) that really made me want to see the movie. So I did. Twice, in fact: once on my own because Rose was otherwise occupied and then again with Rose. I think <cite class="People">Alan Moore</cite>&#8217;s book doesn&#8217;t translate well to cinema&#8212;it might have worked better as a much longer movie or a miniseries. It needs an ensemble cast and time to develop several protagonists. The movie jettisons pretty much everything from the book except V&#8217;s story and follows a more conventional heroic adventure format that misses much of the book&#8217;s political sophistication. I guess Evey&#8217;s story is largely intact, especially her imprisonment, but it suffers in comparison with Evey&#8217;s story in the book. Movie Evey is older than Book Evey, and this allows her to be less dependent on V. But the filmmakers replace Book V and Book Evey&#8217;s coercive power-imbalanced relationship with a more conventional romantic subplot that appears unexpectedly and arbitrarily near the end of the movie. (I certainly wasn&#8217;t expecting that kiss, anyway.) I prefer the movie&#8217;s less Stockholm Syndrome-esque version of Evey&#8217;s escape from prison, but I prefer the book&#8217;s less sentimental version of Evey&#8217;s final crisis and climax after V&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>Other <cite class="Comics">V for Vendetta</cite> thoughts, maybe for writing about in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>The prologue and epilogue with Evey admonishing the viewer that the man is more important than the man&#8217;s ideas: why do the filmmakers undermine V&#8217;s claim that ideas are bulletproof?</li>
<li>The surprising prosperity and invisibility of class and poverty in this fascist dystopia which lost at least several tens of thousands people from its population to plague and genocide, in a world where the U.S.A. has disintegrated into civil war and the Middle East has presumably done the same or been destroyed entirely. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s U.S. culture&#8217;s typical blindness to economic inequality&#8212;everybody&#8217;s middle class in TV land&#8212;but it seems especially egregious in such a political polemical movie.</li>

<p>I take off tomorrow for my grandparents&#8217; home, so I&#8217;ll be gone for the rest of the week. It will be interesting to see how I get by without regular internet access! Steven will still be around and, I hope, posting some of the thoughts he&#8217;s been talking about with me lately.</p>
<p>In addition to being helpful, I should have some time for reading and I&#8217;m bringing a knitting project with me, hoping I&#8217;ll pass through airport security with my needles.  When I come back, though, I can promise at least one comics post. Tonight I finally found the notes I&#8217;d taken for <a href="http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/briefings/letters/711/"><cite class="People">Art Spiegelman</cite>&#8217;s first post-9/11/01 lecture</a>, which he discusses in the introduction to <cite class="Comics">In the Shadow of No Towers</cite>. (I probably shouldn&#8217;t have let <cite class="People">Tom Spurgeon</cite> publish something so conversational and rough, but basically all that I said stands.) So that&#8217;s something I will accomplish, but I&#8217;ve accomplished more than just cleaning and packing this weekend.</p>
<p><img src='https://peiratikos.net/wp/wp-content/images/kiri.jpg' alt='Rose wearing the Kiri shawl' class="lalign" /> I finally finished a shawl for my grandmother, <a href="http://alltangledup.com/"><cite class="People">Polly Outhwaite</cite></a>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.alltangledup.com/movabletype/my_images/my_patterns/kiri.pdf">Kiri</a> (free PDF format pattern).  I had been working on this in early summer but put it aside when I was having trouble with my arm and only picked it up again in the last week to get it finished. The pattern was easy to follow and memorize and I think it makes a lovely shawl. This is yarn that my grandmother gave me, some sort of mohair blend I think in a pale, mottled brown. I think these cones I got are remnants from a closed knitting mill, but I&#8217;ll ask about them when I see her. She used to knit blankets from them and while I have the pattern she used, I&#8217;ve been sticking to smaller projects, shawls, scarves, and soon a sweater.</p>
<p><img src='https://peiratikos.net/wp/wp-content/images/kiri_span.jpg' alt='Rose showing the size of the Kiri shawl' class="ralign"/> I used U.S. #7 needles and with such thin yarn the finished product is practically weightless when it&#8217;s worn. It&#8217;s about 58 inches along the top edge, 29 inches along the central spine that hangs down.  I think each side has 11 points along the edge. I could have blocked it bigger, but my grandmother is not as tall as I am and I think this size will be sufficient. I blocked the shawl by soaking it and then pinning it out to the proper dimensions (I ran a piece of yarn through the top horizontal edge to keep it straight) and shape. Since I finished knitting at 11 last night, I ended up making adjustments until midnight and while exhausted, which probably wasn&#8217;t the best state of affairs.</p>
<p><img src='https://peiratikos.net/wp/wp-content/images/kiri_detail.jpg' alt='detail of Kiri leaf lace pattern' class="lalign" /> I do think it&#8217;s a lovely shawl, light and delicate. I like the repeated leaf pattern that covers it, especially in a light, natural color like this one (although my striped tank top detracts from any simplicity). I think it will be a welcome gift and it has the added advantage of looking more complex than it is. I would recommend this pattern to a first-time lace knitter and it can be expanded to a variety of sizes, from a tiny kerchief to a huge shawl. Mine is midsized, about what you would apparently get with two skeins of <a href="http://wiseneedle.com/yarndetail.asp?id=1831">Kidsilk Haze</a>, but I think it&#8217;s a good size for my purposes, and by this time tomorrow I&#8217;ll know!

<div class="text">
<p>The BBC last week had an <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4132752.stm">interview with <cite class="People">Tim Berners-Lee</cite></a> about the World Wide Web, most interestingly about how blogs are closest to his original idea of a readable/writable web. I&#8217;m sure many of you have seen this already, but there were a few excerpts I especially like that I want to quote here&#8230;.</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea was that anybody who used the web would have a space where they could write and so the first browser was an editor, it was a writer as well as a reader. Every person who used the web had the ability to write something. It was very easy to make a new web page and comment on what somebody else had written, which is very much what blogging is about.</p>
<p>For years I had been trying to address the fact that the web for most people wasn&#8217;t a creative space; there were other editors, but editing web pages became difficult and complicated for people. What happened with blogs and with wikis, these editable web spaces, was that they became much more simple.</p>
<p>When you write a blog, you don&#8217;t write complicated hypertext, you just write text, so I&#8217;m very, very happy to see that now it&#8217;s gone in the direction of becoming more of a creative medium.</p></blockquote>
<hr /><br />
<blockquote><p>when you use the web, you follow links and you should keep bookmarks of the places where following links turns out to be a good idea. When you go to a site and it gives you pointers to places that you find are horrible or unreliable, then don&#8217;t go there again.</p>
<p>You see out there right now, for example, when you look at bloggers some of them are very careful. A good blogger when he says that something&#8217;s happened will have a point to back, and there&#8217;s a certain ethos within the blogging community, you always point to your source, you point all the way back to the original article. If you&#8217;re looking at something and you don&#8217;t know where it comes from, if there&#8217;s no pointer to the source, you can ignore it.</p></blockquote>
<hr /><br />
<blockquote><p>When [the web is] 30, I expect it to be much more stable, something that people don&#8217;t talk about. Really when you talk about an article, you don&#8217;t say, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to write an article on paper!&#8221; The fact that we use pen and paper is sort of rather understood.</p>
<p>Similarly the web will be, hopefully, will be something which is sunk into the background as an assumption. Now, if as technologists develop, we&#8217;ve done our job well, the web will be this universal medium, which will be very, very flexible. It won&#8217;t, itself, have any preconceived notions about what&#8217;s built on top.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that I want to keep it open like that, is partly because I want humanity to have it as a clean slate. My goal for the web in 30 years is to be the platform which has led to the building of something very new and special, which we can&#8217;t imagine now.</p></blockquote>

<p>The comics internet is fucked! And we&#8217;re all part of the problem. Really, you&#8217;re not pushing comics forward. We&#8217;re folks on the internet writing about stuff, and we don&#8217;t matter to anybody but ourselves and the few other people who read us. Just kick back, have fun writing about stuff, and don&#8217;t worry about the forward momentum of the art form.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree that the final sentence of <a href="../../archives/2005/07/12/galaxies/index.html">Rose&#8217;s post</a> was ill-advised. A very bad idea. If you read everything Rose has written about this and think she&#8217;s accusing anybody of being misogynist or claiming she knows what anybody was thinking during recruiting for CBG, you need to work on your reading comprehension skills. The only badly behaved people in that comments thread are Alan David Doane, Steven Berg and, to a somewhat lesser extent, Christopher Allen.</p>
<p>You all are protesting way too much. Why is that?</p>
<p>You spend&#8212;let me count&#8212;one and a half years writing about comics, then you make a couple of fairly mild criticisms of Comic Book Galaxy (and one ill-advised final sentence, yes, we all remember that) and you&#8217;re suddenly PART OF THE PROBLEM!!!</p>
<p>You are all very silly and hysterical. So am I. Maybe you should get over it now, <a href="http://houseoftheded.blogspot.com/2005/07/blogging-about-blogging-theres-debate.html">Logan and friends</a>. I myself am getting over it&#8230; now. Now you try.<a href="index.html#note-377-1" id="ref-377-1">*</a></p>
<p>P.S. Rose did bring up race, Logan. Thanks for reading before ranting.</p>
<p>P.P.S. No, really, we don&#8217;t want to write for CBG. So sorry.</p>

<p>Well, it had to happen someday. Someone&#8217;s finally <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/elayneriggs/112104724918777598/#220514">asked about the existence of women comic book bloggers</a>. And while the obvious response is that they&#8217;re all over <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a>, <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/elayneriggs/112104724918777598/#220515"><cite class="People">Elayne Riggs</cite></a> and <a href="http://realtegan.blogspot.com/#112110794007430555"><cite class="People">Laura Gjovaag</cite></a> only name seven, including themselves. I had no trouble coming up with 20 non-pros off the top of my head, but maybe that just means I&#8217;ve been paying more attention to the issue. It&#8217;s not a community, certainly, but it&#8217;s not nothing and we&#8217;re not all invisible.</p>
<p>Where am I going with this? Nowhere directly, but it coincided with the <a href="http://comicbookgalaxy.com/sethreport_071105.html">first post by a woman</a> at the new <a href="http://comicbookgalaxy.com/">Comic Book Galaxy</a>, although author <cite class="People">Diana Tamblyn</cite> still isn&#8217;t listed among the <a href="http://comicbookgalaxy.com/staff.html"> official contributors</a>. I wasn&#8217;t surprised to see that the new direction CBG would be taking included lots of writing from lots of white guys, but it was interesting to note that (by my count) 12 of the 25 contributors are also bloggers.</p>
<p>Before I go any farther, I&#8217;ll note that I was not one of the women <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/cro2/111972463355937181/#114811">approached by CBG to contribute</a> and I have absolutely no interest in being involved with them anyway. What&#8217;s interesting to me is that so many other bloggers feel differently. I understand that many comics bloggers really want to break into comics writing and that there are already plenty of bloggers writing weekly columns (and arguably some of the best ones) for a wide variety of comics sites. I&#8217;m perfectly happy to write here and do nothing else because I get to set the rules and the parameters (in my case, in collaboration with <cite class="People">Steven</cite>) and then write whatever I want to write. I gave up my dreams of writing professionally a decade ago, so this current setup is pretty much my ideal. So what is it that makes some of these new blogger/columnists consider <a href="http://brillbuilding.blogspot.com/2005/06/ive-been-blogging-for-one-year-now.html">shifting to a wider pop culture focus</a> or <a href="http://johnnybacardi.blogspot.com/2005/06/hello-just-wanted-to-let-you-know-that.html">confining comics reviews to CBG</a>? I don&#8217;t really know beyond what they say there and I&#8217;d love to hear more because I&#8217;ve always been fascinated in why people write the way they do on blogs and what they think they&#8217;re doing with their blogs in the first place. But what do they think they&#8217;re doing with their columns and how do those replace or supplement their blogs? </p>
<p>And here&#8217;s where things get ugly or controversial, and I&#8217;m just going to say what I think with the caveat (which I hope would be obvious to all readers anyway) that obviously this is just what I think and I have no vested interest in whether or not others agree or want to implement my ideas. There&#8217;s no good reason I should matter to you, right? I think if <a href="http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/blog/2005/06/monday-briefing-special-edition-new.html">CBG were a teaching hospital</a>, I wouldn&#8217;t go in for surgery there. It&#8217;s a site that requires <a href="http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/blog/2005/07/tuesday-briefing-you-know-between-you.html">copious editing</a>, and yet not all the punctuation ends up where it belongs. Sure, it&#8217;s a work in progress, but it&#8217;s not the second coming of anything. I have a reputation for despairing that there&#8217;s not more good writing in comics, a complaint that extends to comics criticism. While there aren&#8217;t many CBG columns I think are really badly written, I&#8217;m not getting excited either, not hearing new voices, just some guys on the internet.  And the real, core problem is that they&#8217;re writing as if they&#8217;re not on the internet. This is a site that has <a href="http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/crackshots_001.html">three</a> different <a href="http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/breakdowns_403.html">columns</a> analyzing and <a href="http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/review_062805_icehaven.html">reviewing</a> <cite class="Comics">Ice Haven</cite> in the same week with not only no conversation between them but no links from one piece to another. In fact, if I hadn&#8217;t made those links for you, you&#8217;d be stuck doing what I did and puzzling through the <a href="http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/commentary.html">commentary listing</a> to try to find where the two that aren&#8217;t listed might have been. This is a comics site that talks about comics but not in a way that makes discussions readily available to a casual reader. The google search is effective but inelegant, to say the least.</p>
<p>Why give up the conversational possibilities of a blog for a closed system like this? Why write something online if it might as well be mimeographed? Why have three overlapping reviews and nothing synthesizing them, analyzing the connections and dissonances (and nothing to help readers do this for themselves)? And I realize that none of these CBG bloggers have closed up shop and I really don&#8217;t expect them to. I&#8217;m sure it brings them more prominence than their individual endeavors would and it must be great writing experience to be expected to deliver the same sort of writing on a regular basis (which is yet another reason this would not be the job for me!) and I don&#8217;t think these blogger/columnists have made a bad decision in getting involved here. I do think it&#8217;s a bad idea to think that this version of CBG is the apotheosis of anything.  But I&#8217;m not the whole audience, though I&#8217;m a reader, and it doesn&#8217;t need to appeal to what I think it should be.</p>
<p>But for those keeping score at home, I think it should be more like a blog than a webzine with near-daily updates. It could be an active conversation between all these informed and verbal columnists engaging each other&#8217;s ideas rather than writing in a vacuum for an audience in the ether. It could be easily navigable with a link for the title of each referenced comic or creator connecting to any other uses of those names on the site. In short, it could be intertextual in a way that it&#8217;s not, and I think that lack is its greatest limitation. It&#8217;s not a galaxy with any constellations in it, just a collection of loose stars. And sure, constellations are in part the stories we attach to groups of stars, but it&#8217;s a lot of work for a reader to create those stories right now and there&#8217;s no way to see whether what I call the Big Dipper is someone else&#8217;s Great Bear. </p>
<p>Of course I think it would be good if there were more women writing for CBG if they wanted to and had things they wanted to say, but I also know that there are already women writing for readers who are willing to look and pay attention. We don&#8217;t all have the same interests or tastes in comics or in blogging and I wouldn&#8217;t expect a woman at CBG to speak for me just because we have ovaries, but I&#8217;d be interested to see what she&#8217;d say just as I&#8217;m interested enough to read women bloggers who are writing now. But if there are other women who don&#8217;t want to be part of the move to <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/cro2/111972463355937181/#115197">&#8220;put more &#8216;gal&#8217; into the Galaxy soon&#8221;</a> (especially given the way contributing editor <cite class="People">Chris Allen</cite> <a href="http://www.chrisallenonline.com/2005/06/king-of-all-breasts.html">discusses</a>, <a href="http://www.chrisallenonline.com/2005/06/congraduations.html"> views</a> and <a href="http://www.chrisallenonline.com/2005/06/trojan-hearse.html">interacts</a>  with real-life women) I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a problem at all. I&#8217;m just glad there are other venues where their voices can be heard, and I prefer those anyway.

<div class="text">
<p>This is an important message for comics bloggers who think they&#8217;re doing podcasting. <em>You know who you are</em>.</p>
<p>Read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting">&#8220;Podcasting&#8221;</a> from <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>. Pay especial attention to the first two paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting"><p>Podcasting is a method of publishing sound files to the Internet, allowing users to subscribe to a feed and receive new audio files automatically. Podcasting is distinct from other types of audio content delivery because it uses the RSS 2.0 file format. This technique has enabled many producers to create self-published, syndicated radio shows.</p>
<p>Users subscribe to podcasts using &#8220;podcatching&#8221; software (also called &#8220;aggregator&#8221; software) which periodically checks for and downloads new content</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works: You, the podcaster, have a web site with some audio files (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3">MP3s</a>) and an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Really_Simple_Syndication">RSS 2.0</a> feed that attaches those audio files to it using an RSS feature called <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/enclosuresAggregators">&#8220;enclosures.&#8221;</a> If this is too advanced for you, just think of the RSS feed as a list of audio files that a computer program can read, because that&#8217;s pretty much what it is. Somebody who wants to listen to your podcasts subscribes to your podcast feed with &#8220;podcatching&#8221; software, like <a href="http://ipodder.org/">iPodder</a>. iPodder checks the feed occasionally and downloads new files it finds on the list. You might wonder this publishing method is called <i>podcasting</i>: it&#8217;s named after the iPod, which you can use to listen to the files. You can also, of course, use another kind of digital-audio player or even listen to the files on your computer.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the important part: <strong>If you upload MP3s to your web site and link directly to them on your blog, <em>you are not podcasting.</em></strong> (Unless you use <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, which is so clever that it automatically turns your RSS 2.0 feed into a podcast when you link to an audio file in a post.)</p>
<p>Inform yourself! Learn what podcasting is <em>before</em> you hop on the bandwagon&#8212;unless you <em>want</em> people to think you&#8217;re ignorant and misinformed.

<p>So I haven&#8217;t been here in a while, it seems. I&#8217;ve been sick a lot this winter, but also just completely worn down. I don&#8217;t know when either of those will relent for good, but I&#8217;ll aim for weekly posting and see if I can work up from there. If I have anything to say (and I do have a big post on identification festering, but it&#8217;s not written yet) I&#8217;ll try to get it up here somehow. For tonight, though, just a few quick truths with little analysis.</p>
<p><cite class="Comics">Vimanarama</cite> #2 made me cry a little, but only a little. Dig the Taj Mahal interior, though! I&#8217;m not sold on the coloring and I read a lot faster when the Fireborn are doing their thing. I wish this were going to be more than three issues long.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s up with the (<a href="http://johnnybacardi.blogspot.com/2005/03/well-hello-dere_01.html">potential</a>) <a href="http://comicsatemybrain.blogspot.com/2005/01/up-up-and-away.html">total depletion</a> of other Kentucky comics bloggers? To make up for the gaps in my pseudopeer group, I&#8217;m pushing for a clique of <a href="http://precur.blogspot.com/2005/03/little-something-for-ladies.html">comics bloggers who read manga in the bathtub</a>. It looks like there may be some overlap with the comics bloggers who enjoy gin (a more casual grouping that exists only in my head, as far as I know) which suggests some clear options for socializing that I&#8217;ll bet we&#8217;ll never try.</p>
<p><cite class="People">Steven</cite> is on spring break and thus did a Wednesday comic run, which still seems sort of weird and obscene to me, but I hoped it would net us <cite class="Comics">Project Superior</cite>, which the store had not ordered. They should have one for us next week, and I do realize that if we weren&#8217;t so passive and uncomfortable talking to people we would have had one now. So there was none of that and no manga for my bath, so I resorted to feminist essay collections. From <cite class="Books">Feminism Beside Itself</cite>, I liked <cite class="People">Elspeth Probyn</cite>&#8217;s piece, &#8220;Perverts by Choice.&#8221; She writes of belonging/be-longing as &#8220;a loose <i lang="fr">combinatoire</i> of being and longing, becoming and nostalgia, as composed of lines of desire that run along the singularities of sexualities, bodies, spaces and places.&#8221; (264) I quote this not to scare anyone off from drinking gin or enjoying bathtime manga, but because it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m going to be thinking about off-blog and possibly but probably not on-.</p>
<p>I know <a href="http://spatulaforum.blogspot.com/2005/03/ok-heres-existential-video-review-for.html">not everyone liked <cite class="Movies">I &hearts; Huckabees</cite></a>, but I think the mud sex scene was one of the most emotionally realistic portrayals I&#8217;ve ever seen in a movie. Anyone who disagrees is wrong, but that&#8217;s ok; I know beauty when I see it. I got the double-disc set as a birthday present (<a href="http://tinctoris.com/">thanks!</a>) and am looking forward to rewatching the film itself this weekend. I got very close to finishing a major in philosophy before dropping it, in large part because I hated so many of the other students, so I&#8217;m not sure if that means I&#8217;m more sensitive or less sensitive to dopey philosophy stuff, but nothing in <cite>Huckabees</cite> bothered me.</p>
<p>And continuing my trend of no real segues, I&#8217;m probably going to be teaching a class on sock knitting, so I&#8217;ve been doing a bit of it myself. I have a really hideous pair I made to test some techniques and a cotton/wool yarn (I&#8217;ll have to teach on larger than sock yarn, though, because apparently size 0 needles terrify new knitters) and I should probably put a picture of them up here so that the ugliness will be a good incentive to post something substantive to get it off the top of the page. The plus side is that they fit me perfectly and keep my feet warm when it is too, too cold in the apartment, which has definitely been the case over the last few nights.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t yet done any <a href="../../archives/2005/01/14/proposal/index.html">blogger interviews</a> because I haven&#8217;t really done much of anything except work ridiculously long hours and try to sleep (well, and knit socks). I think I&#8217;m getting close to having my research done for the first, though. I&#8217;m hoping I live in enough of a shame culture that my commenting on this will push me to do it, but past performance has not been a positive indicator, to use work-speak. Maybe soon.

<p>This is a day that will live in whatever the good version of infamy is. After great suspense, <a href="http://secretfriendsociety.com/">The Secret Friend Society</a> is live, featuring <a href="http://www.hopelarson.com/"><cite class="People">Hope Larson</cite></a> and <a href="http://www.keaner.net/"><cite class="People">Kean Soo</cite></a> and their respective webcomics <cite class="Comics">Salamander Dreams</cite> and <cite class="Comics">Jellaby</cite>. I&#8217;m a bit sad it wasn&#8217;t more sinister content, but not really surprised and I&#8217;m looking forward to reading the two stories. But the real reason I&#8217;m obsessed with Hope Larson&#8217;s work is that I&#8217;m hard at work in my head designing a <a href="http://www.hopelarson.com/illo/hamhead.jpg">ham hat</a> even though everyone I&#8217;ve told about my plans thinks it&#8217;s a bad idea. (Oh, and for <cite class="People">Steven</cite>: <a href="http://www.ryanestrada.com/weltonsecret.htm">&#8220;Pah!&#8221;</a>)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also the publication date for <cite class="Books">The World according to Mimi Smartypants</cite>, a novel in the form of online diary entries from the <a href="http://smartypants.diaryland.com/"><cite class="People">Mimi Smartypants</cite> website</a>. I&#8217;d beeen reading entries occasionally and then in December and January gave in to the allure and read the entire archive. It&#8217;s something that makes me laugh, which is rare in written pieces. I&#8217;m sure it helps that we have at least minor things in common &#8212; a past history with the violin, a desire to keep making Greek jokes after college, really maybe not much more than that because she&#8217;s basically cool &#8212; but something just clicks. I&#8217;m looking forward to eventually reading the book version even if it will be repetitive, because I&#8217;m interested in this phenomenon of turning blogs into books. It wouldn&#8217;t work here!</p>
<p>And I feel like I ought to follow the rule of threes, so I&#8217;ll just add that it&#8217;s a great day when it&#8217;s 7:00 am and I&#8217;m not at work already! Variable schedules have their downsides, but right now I&#8217;m not feeling it.</p>
<p>Oh, but more important is <cite class="Comics">Seaguy</cite>, one of my favorite comics from last year, is available in an eminently affordable trade paperback today. I intend to buy a copy when I get off work (which will be late, of course, to compensate for late starts) and curl up and read gleefully. At one point Steven solicited comments on it from my 13-year-old brother to counter the arguments that it was too difficult to follow, but I don&#8217;t know what ever became of them. I just recall that he was curious about who held behind-the-scenes power, what Mickey Eye represented, and whether there was going to be more. Also, did we have any other comics he could read? I think the only way we got him to talk about this one was by telling him we wouldn&#8217;t lend him anything else until he did.
