<div class="text">
<p>Part two of a two(?)-part post. See <a href="https://peiratikos.net/archives/2004/08/23/manchurian-commies/">The Manchurian Candidates 1: Communists</a>. Yesterday was <cite class="People">John Frankenheimer</cite>&#8217;s 1962 <cite class="Movies">The Manchurian Candidate</cite>, today is <cite class="People">Jonathan Demme</cite>&#8217;s 2004 version.</p>
<p>First of all, a question. Does anybody know what year the new movie takes place? Rose is convinced she saw a &#8220;2008&#8243; somewhere in the movie, but I did not and assumed the year was 2004. <i>When</i> the events of the movie occur is important. The 1962 <cite>Candidate</cite> is set in 1956, making it alternate history. It&#8217;s not about what is happening or what will happen, but about what might have happened. The movie&#8217;s concern is not paranoid speculation about Communist plots, but criticism of that paranoia.</p>
<p>I wrote yesterday that the movie validates McCarthyist fear even as it criticizes it&#8212;except that the validation is subverted by the fact that the object of fear is created through manipulation of fear. The alternate history further subverts. If the movie were set in the future, there would be room for speculation as to the possibility of a real Communist plot. But set in the past (or the present time, creating an alternate present), the movie explicitly discourages such speculation by emphasizing the fictionality of the threat. You can still speculate about possible Communist plots, certainly, but the alternate history is a subtle warning that speculation isn&#8217;t the point.</p>
<p>The 1962 <cite>Candidate</cite>, set in 1956, is about a Communist conspiracy that manipulates anti-Commie fear to turn a fictional threat of Commie infiltration into a real threat. The 2004 <cite>Candidate</cite> is about a plot to manipulate fear that&#8217;s going on now, in the real world. The United States government is manipulating public fear and insecurity, for good or ill, to promote the War on Terror(ism). (This isn&#8217;t a new tactic for the governments&#8212;in fact, it&#8217;s exactly what Senator McCarthy was doing.) If the movie is set in 2004, it&#8217;s metaphorically about that manipulation of fear. If it&#8217;s set in 2008, it enters the scary realm of <i>possibility</i>. The movie&#8217;s residence in the realm of implausibility does little to soften its speculative power. Rogue government officials and corporate officers are probably not going to be endorsing a science-fictional mind-controlled candidate in the 2008 elections&#8212;but people with power are capable of inventing, and have actually  and will continue to invent, more viable and no less drastic  conspiracies.</p>
<p>The modern equivalent of Commies would be Islamic terrorists (although planting sleepers in the White House isn&#8217;t really their style), but the new movie abandons the old movie&#8217;s specter of an outside threat. Terrorism is a constant present in the movie, but never a direct one. There are news reports of terrorist attacks, orange and red terror(ism) alerts, the familiar political debate of security against outsider terrorist vs. civil liberties for American citizens&#8212;but there are no terrorists or terrorist attacks. The terrorists are phantoms, much less substantial than the fear of terrorism. The old <cite>Candidate</cite> is resolutely anti-Communist even as it criticizes McCarthyism, but the new movie focuses its critique solely on current American political rhetoric. (An absence of anti-terrorist sentiment is not the same as implicit approval of terrorism.)</p>
<p>The older movie is at least a little optimistic, letting rationalism and democracy save the day as Ben Marco breaks his brainwashing and breaks out Raymond Shaw as well. It&#8217;s not a great victory for America&#8212;the government would probably have fallen to the Commies if not for Raymond&#8217;s desperate intervention&#8212;but it&#8217;s more than the new movie offers. <cite class="People">Frank Sinatra</cite>&#8217;s Ben Marco is basically a good guy who seems to be going crazy for a while but manages to pull himself together and convince his Army superiors about the Commie conspiracy. <cite class="People">Denzel Washington</cite>&#8217;s Ben seems to begin along the same trajectory, but he never pulls out of the descent into madness&#8212;he never manages to convince the Army, and most of the people who believe either disappear or turn out to be working for the other side. Delp seems to be Ben&#8217;s friend, but he used to work for Manchurian International making brain implants. And after Delp helps Ben recover his hidden memories, Delp disappears&#8212;did the conspiracy get rid of him, or was he working for them all along, Ben&#8217;s recovery of his memories merely part of their plan? Rosie seems to be helping Ben&#8212;but why is she helping? (More on Rosie below.) Ben seems to be the only character in the story definitely not in on the conspiracy&#8212;until that scene in the classroom on election day, when Raymond asks him why he never wondered if the conspiracy <i>knew</i> he was going to discover the truth. What if Ben&#8217;s discovery of the truth and attempts to convince people of it are only another part of the conspiracy&#8217;s byzantine plot? Frank Sinatra saved us from the Communists, but now there&#8217;s nobody to save us from ourselves.</p>
<p>The Rosie subplot in the new movie may be the most brilliant evocation of conspiracy-theory paranoia I&#8217;ve seen on film. <cite class="People">Janet Leigh</cite>&#8217;s Rosie is intriguing and worrying, but <cite class="People">Kimberly Elise</cite>&#8217;s is downright scary. This Rosie is definitely spying on Ben&#8212;she works for the FBI. She seems to be trying to protect him. Why? The obvious answer is that she was sent to keep an eye on him after the Army decided he was unstable and dangerous to Raymond, and that she gradually becomes convinced that Ben is right about the conspiracy and decides to help him defeat it or at least protect him from it. <cite>The Manchurian Candidate</cite> is the sort of movie that makes you distrust anything that can be described as the &#8220;obvious&#8221; answer, especially if the obvious answer makes somebody seem trustworthy. Rosie is as untrustworthy as any character in the movie, but the disturbing thing about her is that her allegiance is genuinely unknowable. Her actions make it look superficially like she&#8217;s working against the conspiracy or at least doesn&#8217;t know it exists&#8212;she never does anything that makes her obviously a conspirator. She never even does anything that might arouse suspicion. But she also never does anything that <i>can&#8217;t</i> be interpreted as benefiting the conspiracy. Why does she shoot but not kill Ben after he assassinates Raymond and Eleanor Shaw? Was it an panicked impulse reaction, or was she trying to make it look like he&#8217;d been killed? For whose benefit? Why does she erase all records of his being in the building where the assassination took place? Is she simply protecting him from the consequences of the murders he was brainwashed into committing (or hiding him from the remnants of the conspiracy), or is she covering up for the conspiracy? Who&#8217;s really in charge of the investigation of the secret brainwashing hospital at the end of the movie?</p>
<p>The new <cite>The Manchurian Candidate</cite> isn&#8217;t exactly pessimistic. It doesn&#8217;t preclude the older <cite>Candidate</cite>&#8217;s guardedly optimistic ending, but it doesn&#8217;t offer the luxury of security as the older movie does. After all, Eleanor Shaw is the movie&#8217;s foremost proponent of security.

<div class="text">
<p><cite class="People">Roger Ebert</cite>, in his <a href="http://suntimes.com/output/ebert1/wkp-news-manchurian30f.html">review</a> of <cite class="People">Jonathan Demme</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Movies">The Manchurian Candidate</cite>, writes, &#8220;To compare Demme&#8217;s version with Frankenheimer&#8217;s is sort of irrelevant.&#8221; This is a ridiculous statement. As <cite class="People">J.W. Hastings</cite> pointed out when somebody asked him why on Earth he was <a href="http://www.forager23.com/archives/000148.html">comparing apples and oranges</a> <cite class="People">J.R.R. Tolkien</cite> and <cite class="People">Robert Howard</cite>, &#8220;I firmly believe that it is not only okay but a critic&#8217;s duty to compare apples and oranges.&#8221; Indeed. Of course, <cite class="People">John Frankenheimer</cite>&#8217;s and Demme&#8217;s movies aren&#8217;t like apples and orange, they&#8217;re more like&#8212;oranges and grapefruits? At any rate, they&#8217;re both based on the same novel by <cite class="People">Richard Condon</cite>, they have similar plots, they engage related political themes in very different political climates. What&#8217;s not to compare?</p>
<p>If Frankheimer&#8217;s <cite>Candidate</cite> has a flaw, it&#8217;s that it seems to want to criticize McCarthyism even as it validates McCarthyism&#8217;s worst nightmares of Communist infiltration. The movie conjures a paranoid fantasy of Cold War politics in which there don&#8217;t seem to be any genuinely Communist politicians in the U.S. government, but there is at least one who&#8217;s married to a Communist. Senator Johnny Iselin, a bold caricature of Senator Joseph McCarthy, is a drunken buffoon easily controlled by his wife Eleanor, who is the American handler for a brainwashed Soviet sleeper agent planted in the United States. The sleeper happens to be Eleanor&#8217;s son Raymond Shaw. The plan: get Senator Iselin on the ballot as the vice-presidential candidate, then send Raymond to the convention to assassinate presidential candidate Ben Arthur, leaving Iselin to ride a wave of freedom-loving hysteria right into the Oval Office, where he will be controlled by the Communists through Eleanor. (Except that Eleanor, upon learning her own son is the assassin, vows to avenge her son and destroy her Communist allies who destroyed her son.) This ridiculous plan would have gone off smoothly if not for the intervention of Major Ben Marco, who was leader of Raymond&#8217;s platoon during the Korean War and who, when the platoon was captured and taken to Manchuria for brainwashing, was instructed to award Raymond the Congressional Medal of Honor (part of the plan to make Raymond&#8217;s stepfather Senator Iselin look like a good vice-presidential candidate). Ben, plagued by nightmares&#8212;a ladies&#8217; gardening club meeting mixed surreally with a meeting of Russian and Chinese military leaders in which a Chinese doctor does Freudian brainwashing/hypnotism on Marco and his platoon&#8212;figures something must be wrong. At first he fails to convince his Army commanders anything but that he&#8217;s going insane, but he eventually convinces them he&#8217;s onto something and an investigation of Raymond begins. Ben tries to unhypnotize Raymond, thinks he must have failed when Raymond disappears on a mission with instructions from his evil mother&#8212;only to discover, to his relief and horror, that he had succeeded in breaking Raymond free, but that Raymond decided the only way to stop the Commie plot was to assassinate his mother and Johnny Iselin himself. He explains to Ben, &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t have stopped them, the army couldn&#8217;t have stopped them&#8212;so I had to.&#8221; Then he shoots himself. Not a happy ending, but at least a victory for the good guys, such as they are. The movie suggests that the United States is vulnerable to Communist infiltration&#8212;not least because hysterical fearmongers like McCarthy make it easier for infiltrators to manipulate the public&#8212;but that there are a few good people willing and able to stand up and fight back for America.</p>
<p>I said that if the movie has a flaw, it&#8217;s the simultaneous criticism and validation of McCarthyism. This isn&#8217;t quite a flaw, but it is a little weak. If the Commies had been capable of orchestrating and nearly carrying off such an intricate plot to seize control of the White House, Joe McCarthy would have had reason to be worried. On the other hand, the movie makes a good point that those who wish to take power unscrupulously could easily adopt McCarthyist tactics to cultivate public fear and manipulate political paranoia to their advantage.</p>
<p>The good guys win in the end, but there&#8217;s one worrying thread left untied at the end: Rosie, Ben&#8217;s weirdo girlfriend he meets on a train. The common theory to explain Rosie&#8217;s strange behavior is, maybe Ben has also been brainwashed to receive post-hypnotic instructions, and Rosie speaks to him in code to trigger instructions. The biggest problem with the theory is that, if it&#8217;s right, Ben&#8217;s hypnotic triggers are nothing at all like Raymond&#8217;s. Raymond always responds to a suggestion to play Solitaire, and the sight of the Queen of Diamonds (a symbol associated with his mother by way of a massive oedipal complex) puts him in a receiving state where he obeys any command he hears. Rosie&#8217;s dialogue with Ben is much more complex, and Ben never enters a trance state as does Raymond. There is one tenuous coincidence which seems to support the theory: The first thing Rosie says to Ben when they meet on the train is, &#8220;Maryland is a beautiful state.&#8221; Ben replies by pointing out that they&#8217;re in currently in Delaware&#8212;why would Rosie mention Maryland? Later in the movie, Raymond and his love Josie fly overnight from New York to Maryland to get married. Why go to Maryland? Ben is waiting to arrest Raymond when they return, and Josie informs Ben they&#8217;ve just returned from Maryland. Raymond ended up marrying Josie after years of estrangement only because his mother invited her to a party. Is this some absurdly convoluted subplot put in motion by Eleanor Iselin? Get Raymond and Josie married and then hypnotically command Ben to believe that the power of love may cure Raymond of his brainwashing? The idea is even more implausible than the rest of the movie, but it&#8217;s the sort of paranoid speculation the movie seems to encourage. Nevertheless, nothing more than paranoid speculation ever comes of it. Ben tells Rosie everything he plans to do&#8212;she could easily have prevented him from helping Raymond. Rosie may very well be Ben&#8217;s handler, but there&#8217;s no indication that Ben can be controlled as Raymond can.</p>
<p>Eleanor Iselin (and Johnny, unwittingly) are apparently the only Americans involved in the Communist conspiracy. If the conspiracy remains intact after their deaths, that fact remains buried deep in the movie&#8217;s subtext. More likely, <i>this</i> plot has been defeated. (But will there be more?)

<div class="text">
<p>I was going to start this post by asserting that I haven&#8217;t followed more illustrious bloggers into hiatus because I had gotten tired of writing, but only because of a total lack of time, not to mention technology meltdowns that have been resolved at least in the past week. But then I realized that there is even more too it than that. Basically since the beginning of the Peiratikos blog, my interest in comics has been waning. Occasionally there&#8217;s a <cite class="Comics">Seaguy</cite> to perk me up, but I mostly stick with it because I like talking with <cite class="People">Steven</cite> about things we&#8217;ve both read and because I enjoy some of my fellow writers in the blogosphere and because it&#8217;s good practice to be writing.  But I was uninspired and missing blogging only in that I felt some guilt about not keeping up with it. Then last week I got some sort of flu and was stuck in bed and ended up reading something that changed all of that. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, reading <a href="http://www.scottpilgrim.com/"><cite class="Comics">Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s Precious Little Life</cite></a> by <cite class="People">Bryan O&#8217;Malley</cite> was something of a conversion experience.</p>
<p>I agree with <a href="https://peiratikos.net/archives/2004/08/17/scott-pilgrim/">Steven</a> about the contents of the book, though I don&#8217;t necessarily endorse quoting of <cite class="People">Foreigner</cite> lyrics. Scott is a relentlessly self-absorbed 23-year-old Romantic musician in a nonsexual relationship with 17-year-old Chinese-Canadian Knives Chau who forsakes her (kinda) for the literal girl of his dreams, super-cool American rollerblading delivery girl Ramona Flowers. But there&#8217;s more to it than that. For one thing, the art is amazingly cute,  unique manga-ish flatly layered yet static black-and-white scenes. It&#8217;s cute, very cute. I know I said that already, but I emphasize because I might have avoided it for fear of cuteness had Steven not pushed for it, because I&#8217;m afraid that cute stories can&#8217;t live up to my cuteness standards, whereas ugly stories tend to be fine at staying ugly. But what&#8217;s more impressive is that Scott is such a likable hero even while his faults are all totally evident. It&#8217;s clear why his bandmates are charmed with Scott (and also why Kim can see through him) and why his roommate Wallace tolerates his general helplessness. He&#8217;s endearingly self-assured, unquestioningly sure that he&#8217;s the hero of his own narrative. </p>
<p>So there I was, 24 and not in a band but soaking in the bath, trying to open my sinuses, feeling frumpy and unfriendly, and Scott Pilgrim managed to get through anyway. I don&#8217;t know what more to say than that it was charmingly written, with a feel of both real affection and real communication that is rare in comics. <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite> made me wonder what ever became of all the bands I hung out with back in high school, when I was a high-strung non-physical Catholic school girl not unlike Knives. I assume many of them think of themselves in the same inflated terms Scott Pilgrim would use to assess his own life, but somehow this is much easier to tolerate in a fictional character than it would be in my old circle of friends if we hadn&#8217;t all drifted in our own directions. The funniest line is not, as Steven erroneously believes, Scott&#8217;s lack of knowledge about <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/">amazon.ca</a>&#8217;s web address, but that when major characters get ratings (whether as to hotness or just general goodness is unclear) Scott&#8217;s 19-year-old sister is rated &#8220;&#8216;T&#8217; for Teen.&#8221;</p>
<p>And obviously I successfully coerced Steven into reading <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite>, meaning that I got an email on my first day back to work saying &#8220;Not only is everything grammatical and spelled correctly, it&#8217;s intelligent, witty, pomo playful.&#8221; That first part is almost the most essential in my book, as I think everyone is right to refuse to take comics seriously as long as comics writers (/artists/letterers) are unwilling to write properly and get their writing edited before going to press.  (Most recently, this meant fury at <cite class="People">Peter David</cite> or whichever <cite class="Comics">Captain Marvel</cite> staffer couldn&#8217;t bother to do a quick search to realize that <cite class="People">Anne Heche</cite> is an Anne-with-an-E. Seriously, people, this is the easiest stuff ever, and it makes you look like morons and makes me despise you. Trust me on this.) At any rate, <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite> is seriously well-written, funny and poignant and self-aware, smart without being at all pretentious, full of goofy banalities without being stupid. It was a little depressing to see how young Bryan Lee O&#8217;Malley is, but I&#8217;m ok with the idea that I&#8217;m not going to accomplish much, so it&#8217;s not a competition. At any rate, he&#8217;s clearly very talented, an excellent storyteller with a good ear for dialogue and an eye for the details that matter. I look forward to seeing the next installment of Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s life (and we have to wait &#8217;til <em>2005</em>??) and whatever else he&#8217;ll be creating after.

<p><cite class="People">Alan David Doane</cite> writes in his <a href="http://comicbookgalaxy.com/081004review.html">review of <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite></a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://comicbookgalaxy.com/081004review.html"><p><b>Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s Precious Little Life</b> is, among other things, a story about the dumb things guys do in their 20s, and the complicated minefield that is the relationship tapestry of any group of people, but especially, again, those in their hormone-soaked early adult years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s irresponsibility comes from a romanticism that seems inspired more by video games and rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll than by Byron. Scott celebrates love and heroism, and he embraces his own individuality to the point of annoying his friends. He has no connection to reality. He obsesses over his romantic fantasies, but he can&#8217;t figure out that the URL for <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/">Amazon.ca</a> is <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/">amazon.ca</a>. When his brilliant plan to lure the delivery girl of his dreams to his door is thwarted by <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/">Amazon.ca</a>&#8217;s inability to deliver CDs within minutes of his ordering them online, he flies into a rage. Reality for Scott is a half-glimpsed mystery that continuously thwarts his attempts to escape it, but he seems to have managed for 23 years to avoid facing it, with little consequence. He&#8217;s a freeloader with no job prospects, but he&#8217;s collected a group of friends willing to support him as he pursues his own romantic individuality.</p>
<p>His strategy in life is to elevate banal experience into narratives of romance and heroism, as in his story about meeting Knives Chau on the bus. Knives is on the bus being badgered about boyfriends by her mother, she drops her books, Scott helps her pick them up and tells her, &#8220;Hey&#8230; don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221; Hardly gripping stuff (Scott&#8217;s friends are unimpressed), but the art&#8212;especially the final shot of Scott, filling three quarters of the page, the point of view tilted and slightly below Scott for extra dynamism&#8212;makes the story look exciting.</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://peiratikos.net/wp-content/images/scott-pilgrim-awesome.png" alt="Scott Pilgrim meets Knives" width="400" height="427" /></div>
<h3>&#8220;Scott Pilgrim is dating a high schooler!&#8221;</h3>
<p>Knives Chau is an ideal &#8220;girlfriend&#8221; for Scott. He doesn&#8217;t want sex or even kissing. Knives is still deep in the teenage world of ridiculous complex webs of (quasi)romantic relationships in yearbook class become epics of love and betrayal. She totally buys Scott&#8217;s rock-hero image&#8212;the first time she hears his band play, her eyes acquire a starry, almost zombielike glassiness of pure adoration. Her infatuation with Scott&#8217;s heroic self-image makes her a threat. Scott loves her because she tells him stories and because she adores him, but that adoration means their relationship is in constant crisis. They hover on the edge of a first kiss, neither falling over or stepping back, and that&#8217;s how Scott likes it&#8212;he certainly doesn&#8217;t seem interested in taking the relationship to the next level. There&#8217;s the danger that Knives will, but it must seem to Scott like a safe danger, since Knives is embarrassed even to hold hands and seems simply to enjoy the attention of an older man. But her obsession with the band looks dangerously like taking it to the next level, which is confirmed when Knives shoves the relationship into physicality.</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://peiratikos.net/wp-content/images/scott-pilgrim-kissing.png" alt="Scott Pilgrim Kissing" width="400" height="315" /></div>
<p>The kiss is complicated by the recent entrance of Ramona Flowers into Scott&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Ramona Flowers is the girl of Scott&#8217;s dreams. She rollerblades through a <a href="http://ssdoo.gsfc.nasa.gov/education/just_for_fun/startrek.html#subspace">subspace highway</a> which takes a route through Scott&#8217;s brain as she delivers packages for <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/">Amazon.ca</a>. Through no fault of his own, as a side effect of subspace travel, he gets totally obsessed with Ramona as she glides through his every dream.</p>
<p>Ramona Flowers is another ideal girlfriend for Scott. Unlike poor Knives, Ramona appeals to Scott&#8217;s sexual appetite as well as his romance. She turns his life into a music video/video game, complete with ridiculous mythic backstory about seven evil ex-boyfriends Scott must defeat to win her. Knives has only her high-school stories and her adoration. Ramona isn&#8217;t as impressed with Scott&#8217;s idiosyncracies, but her appearance in Scott&#8217;s life skyrockets him into his own precious fantasy world.</p>
<h3>He&#8217;s a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes<br />
Yeah a juke box hero, stars in his eyes</h3>
<p>The book starts out looking like slice-of-life, but Scott&#8217;s precious little life overpowers the naturalistic storytelling and replaces it with a narrative inspired by the (post)modern heroic romances of rock stars and video games. Can he get away with that? What are the limits of his romanticism? What&#8217;ll happen with Knives? Will Scott ever face the consequences of his insistence on being the hero of whatever story he finds himself in? Will he end up an evil ex-boyfriend himself?

<p>Rose and I got some fun books from <a href="http://www.halfpricebooks.com/">Half Price Books</a> the other day. They&#8217;re published by <a href="http://www.iconbooks.co.uk/">Icon Books</a>, which publishes &#8220;intelligent non-fiction.&#8221; We purchased <a href="http://www.iconbooks.co.uk/book.cfm?isbn=1-84046-118-7"><cite class="Books">Introducing Derrida</cite></a>, <a href="http://www.iconbooks.co.uk/book.cfm?isbn=1-84046-086-5"><cite class="Books">Introducing Foucault</cite></a>, and <a href="http://www.iconbooks.co.uk/book.cfm?isbn=1-84046-489-5"><cite class="Books">Postmodernism for Beginners</cite></a> (which seems to be the same book as <a href="http://www.iconbooks.co.uk/book.cfm?isbn=1-84046-489-5"><cite class="Books">Introducing Postmodernism</cite></a> listed in Icon&#8217;s catalogue).</p>
<p>(I hesitated to call it the &#8220;same&#8221; book, as I was reminded suddenly of the Philosophy 101 problem of identity and ships. One plank on the deck of a wooden ship is replaced with a new one. Is the ship with a replaced plank the <i>same</i> ship as the pre-replacement ship? How many planks must be removed before the ship becomes a <i>different</i> ship? One plank? All of them? A single splinter of one plank? Does the ship have a constant identity which survives replacements of planks? What about humans, in whose bodies cells constantly die and are replace with new cells? An obvious answer [to me, anyway] is that the ship is both same and different, or neither same or different.)</p>
<p>Not all would call these books comic books, I guess. This excerpt from <a href="http://www.iconbooks.co.uk/book.cfm?isbn=1-84046-069-5"><cite class="Books">Introducing Melanie Klein</cite></a> illustrates what the books look like:</p>
<div class="image-link"><a href="http://www.iconbooks.co.uk/images/inmelkspr.gif"><img src="https://peiratikos.net/wp-content/images/thumb-inmelkspr.png" alt="Introducing Melanie Klein" /></a></div>
<p><cite>Postmodernism for Beginners</cite> <i>usually</i> clearly distinguishes typeset text from comics with handwritten speech balloons, but the two often mix together. <cite>Introducing Derrida</cite> blurs the distinction by setting the speech balloons in type and mixing text and pictures more freely. Are these books comic art, or are they prose illustrated with comic art? What is &#8220;comic art?&#8221;</p>
<p>I know of two well-known and widely used definitions (I&#8217;d like to learn of others if any of you readers know of them): <cite class="People">Will Eisner</cite>&#8217;s &#8220;sequential art&#8221; and <cite class="People">Scott McCloud</cite>&#8217;s elaboration: &#8220;juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or produce an aesthetic response in the viewer&#8221; (<a href="http://scottmccloud.com/store/books/uc.html"><cite class="Comics">Understanding Comics</cite></a>, p. 9).</p>
<p>In <cite>Understanding Comics</cite>, McCloud takes care to create a definition of comics that doesn&#8217;t encompass written words. Comic art must include pictorial images. That means <cite>Seaguy</cite>&#8212;a sequence of pictorial and other images&#8212;is a comic, but <cite>War and Peace</cite>&#8212;a sequence of non-pictorial images (letters, punctuation, etc.) is not a comic. This blog post is a comic. An illustrated <cite>War and Peace</cite> would be a comic.</p>
<p><cite class="People">Craig Thompson</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Comics">Blankets</cite> is called an &#8220;illustrated novel&#8221; on its cover. Illustrations are used to clarify or explain. In an illustrated text, the illustrations are subordinate to the text (in my experience). In Thompson&#8217;s comic book, his pictures are stronger than his words. The pictures convey powerful meaning, and the words are often pale illustrations of the pictures. Why is <cite>Blankets</cite> called an &#8220;illustrated novel?&#8221; Probably because Thompson, or somebody, thought it sounds better (i.e., most people don&#8217;t associate it immediately with comic books) than &#8220;graphic novel.&#8221; &#8220;Pictorial novel&#8221; is too obvious&#8212;people would realize it&#8217;s still a comic book. But I&#8217;m less interested in why Thompson (or somebody) would want to superficially obfuscate <cite>Blankets</cite>&#8217;s status as a comic book than in why he chose &#8220;illustrated novel&#8221; as the obfuscatory term, whether he considered the connotation of subordination in the word &#8220;illustrated.&#8221; (See also Rose&#8217;s <a href="https://peiratikos.net/archives/2004/02/11/but-comic-book-doesnt-work-for-what-we-do-these-days/">&#8220;But &#8216;comic book&#8217; doesn&#8217;t work for what we do these days.&#8221;</a>)</p>
<p>(&#8221;Novel&#8221; causes as many problems as &#8220;illustrated.&#8221; &#8220;Raina&#8221; is a combination of two of Thompson&#8217;s ex-girlfriends. Thompson neglects to mention in the book that he has a sister as well as a brother. Is <cite>Blankets</cite> autobiography? Autobiographical fiction or fictionalized autobiography? Fiction or nonfiction? Both and neither?)</p>
<p>Should pictorial images dominate in comics? Or should they never be subordinate? Both seem risky additions to the definition of comics. The latter at least would likely lead to the rejection of <cite>Understanding Comics</cite> as a comic.</p>
<p>What is comic art?

<p>Because it&#8217;s easier than writing a substantive post, I&#8217;m going to get infected by a meme. <a href="http://mercurystudio.blogspot.com/2004_08_01_mercurystudio_archive.html#109171929769385025">Quoth <cite class="People">Steve Lieber</cite></a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://mercurystudio.blogspot.com/2004_08_01_mercurystudio_archive.html#109171929769385025"><p>I&#8217;d like to challenge other bloggers to come up with their own list of eleven titles that libraries should shelve. No rules, but participants are encouraged to cite a variety of genres, and you get extra bonus points if you can avoid repeating a publisher. One-line summaries are nice, but not required. And no, they don&#8217;t have to be all-ages books, though all-ages lists are certainly welcome. (Links open in new windows.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Eleven books from eleven publishers makes for an especially arbitrary list. I could list fifty comics that libraries should have, but sticking to the rules does keep the list reasonably short and diverse. The first six are good for readers of all ages, the latter five are probably not OK for younger children but may be enjoyed by intelligent young teenagers. They&#8217;re all good comics for adults to read.</p>

<blockquote><p>Like costumed heroes? Confidentially, we in the comic mag business refer to them as &#8220;long underwear characters&#8221;! And, as you know, they&#8217;rea dime a dozen! But, we think you may find our <b>Spiderman</b> just a bit&#8230; different!</p></blockquote>
<p>I hate it when people mispell &#8220;Spider-Man.&#8221; A lot of people, even superhero comics readers, consistently spell it &#8220;Spiderman.&#8221; Can&#8217;t they remember a simple hyphen?</p>
<p>Apparently <cite class="People">Stan Lee</cite> had trouble with the name as well. I just read Spider-Man&#8217;s debut from <cite class="Comics">Amazing Fantasy</cite> #15 (reprinted in the <cite class="Comics">Marvel Age Classic Origins</cite> collection), and I note that Lee spells the name &#8220;Spider-Man&#8221; twice during the story and &#8220;Spiderman&#8221; ten times.</p>
<p>I also learned that Spider-Man had a show-business career before he devoted his life to Great Responsibility. I knew about his brief pre-superheroic wrestling career, but I had no idea he made television appearances and became &#8220;the sensation of the nation.&#8221;

<div class="text">
<p>You can&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you. Back when I read <cite class="Comics">Seaguy</cite> #1,  <a href="https://peiratikos.net/archives/2004/05/21/da-fug/">I said the story was boustrophedon</a>, and of course I was right. (Although I&#8217;m convinced enough not to bother looking it up that the hieroglyphs are not boustrophedon, because nobody writes boustrophedon script vertically.) While it was awfully prescient of me to recognize that the story would swing around so that its end is the beginning only up a notch,  in retrospect I realize a lot of <cite class="People">Grant Morrison</cite> stories do that. But <cite>Seaguy</cite> does more than that. When people are discussing what happened and what happens next, the bigger question seems to be whether Seaguy knows this is boustrophedon, whether he has fought his way down one line and back another to find himself right where he began though slightly different. Or is it a Moebius strip or a circle or something like that, where he passes Go and grabs a new pal and ends up back at the start as if nothing has ever changed? </p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a question that really interests me, or at least not one I want answered. I don&#8217;t have any problem believing this is a cycle Seaguy has repeated before without knowing it, and that at best he&#8217;s learning incrementally as he goes, but that requires the Mickey Eye system to be something like the Matrix, giving Seaguy free will and freedom merely to be able to take them away when he (mis)uses them. The idea isn&#8217;t  just that a person can only give away self-awareness by consensual choice, because  we see naked Doc Hero being coercively brainwashed, and Seaguy goes through a similar process less nude process. Other readers think Seaguy is more aware and planning subversive activities. If he isn&#8217;t now, I&#8217;m sure he will be soon, if we clamoring readers get our promised &#8220;Slaves of Mickey Eye&#8221; sequel. I like the <i>am-bi-gyoo-ity</i>, and I like it that it&#8217;s not clear whether Mickey Eye (whoever the Eye corporation/government may be) approves of it.</p>
<p>And since I&#8217;m now a pro at clairvoyant exegesis, I have a new theory. Although it&#8217;s perhaps not obvious in <cite>Seaguy</cite>&#8217;s plot, Seaguy is himself following closely in the path of another famously watery hero, but I&#8217;m pretty sure he doesn&#8217;t know this. I realized that the servants of Mickey Eye who were reeducating Doc Hero and Seaguy had a strangely consistent way of reminding them about consensual reality.  &#8220;<em>Nobody</em> wants the Eye to be unhappy.&#8221; &#8220;<em>Nobody</em> actually thinks you&#8217;re crazy&#8230; you just got bit by a crazy thing.&#8221; &#8220;<em>Nobody</em> cares about your stupid hat.&#8221; At first I thought these were just versions of &#8220;We have always been at war with Eurasia,&#8221; but I think it runs deeper. Who is this <em>nobody</em> who opposes all that is accepted and acceptable? Seaguy, the hero and protagonist and subverter of the enforced status quo! Well, maybe he will be, or is sometimes. But that&#8217;s what made it clear who he resembles, a more famous <em>nobody</em>, <a href="http://www.polytropos.org/archives/000002.html">Odysseus</a>.</p>
<p>As we all recall, Odysseus left the Trojan War having angered Poseidon, who kept him from going home until he&#8217;d wandered for ten years and lost all his crew, though he retained the love of his canny wife. His most famous exploit, the one we all recall, is his runin with the uncivilized Cyclops, Polyphemus, whom he blinded. Polyphemus wanted to know who his visitor was, and ever-wily Odysseus said his name was &#8220;Nobody&#8221; (well, sort of, since it&#8217;s hard to translate accurately, as well as being an elaborate pun on the name of Athena&#8217;s mother) so that when the other Cyclopes came to check up on their screaming relative Polyphemus responded to their inquiries by saying, &#8220;Nobody is hurting me!&#8221; And so the Cyclopes left, and soon Odysseus left too, with plenty of cheese and wine and goodies, though minus a few companions.</p>
<p>So where does this leave Seaguy? He&#8217;s been losing beloved companions, and he&#8217;s definitely dealing with a one-eyed menace. He&#8217;s a nobody in a larger sense, an unemployed slacker who would like to be a hero but <a href="https://peiratikos.net/archives/2004/06/18/seaguy/">can&#8217;t even outhero iron umbrellas</a>. He enjoys stories to the point where he doesn&#8217;t seem to differentiate between the Mickey Eye show and Aten-Hut&#8217;s hieroglyphic history (and even though I&#8217;m super-picky about joke names, because no joke was made about it, that is the best joke name I&#8217;ve heard in a long time). And it&#8217;s possible he has a faithful woman waiting for him, She-Beard, who loudly laments the fact that &#8220;not one man [has she] found,&#8221; perhaps because she hasn&#8217;t yet had the dramatic unveiling scene in which (he hopes) she&#8217;ll recognize Seaguy as her own and take him up to her bedroom, or perhaps because she&#8217;s looking for a hero who is also a no-man and she hasn&#8217;t yet figured out that this is Seaguy&#8217;s gig. Of course, it&#8217;s not clear whether she&#8217;s a wily Penelope who&#8217;s manipulating the more powerful forces around her or whether she&#8217;s merely bait Mickey Eye uses to bring heroes out into the open, but there&#8217;s time for this to become clear. There&#8217;s time for all of this, since time, too, waits for no man.

<p>Rose and I were at Target yesterday looking for the Marvel Age <cite class="Comics">Spider-Man&#8217;s Pal, Gus Beezer</cite> book for her brother&#8217;s birthday, which was unfortunately unavailable. We picked up <cite class="Comics">Classic Origins</cite> instead, which reprints the first issues of a bunch of Marvel characters. We also picked up Marvel Age reprints of <cite class="Comics">Ultimate X-Men: The Tomorrow People</cite>, <cite class="Comics">Ultimate Spider-Man: Power and Responsibility</cite>, and <cite class="Comics">Emma Frost: Higher Learning</cite>&#8212;if you&#8217;re going to get comics of questionable quality, you might as well get them cheap.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading <cite class="Comics">Ultimate X-Men</cite>, and it seems to have been expurgated. I&#8217;ve looked at these issues in online previews and flipping through the TPB at the bookstore, and I distinctly remember several scenes which are missing from this printing. The opening scene of Sentinels slaughtering people in L.A. and then stepping on a mutatn and his puppy are gone. The scenes of Storm, Colossus, and Beast being recruited to the X-Men are gone. Wolverine being shot down by Weapon X as he leaves the airport in issue #2 is gone. Wolverine hacking his teammates to pieces in the Danger Room is gone. Enough of the text is left intact that you can tell those last two scenes did happen, but their removal leaves obvious and awkward hiccups in the narrative&#8217;s pacing. (Bumps which are somewhat mitigated by the pacing hiccups which the insufficiently skillful <cite class="People">Mark Millar</cite> created himself.) This expurgation doesn&#8217;t really make the book more &#8216;appropriate&#8217; for children: the most graphic violence has been removed, but it&#8217;s still a very violent story. I&#8217;ve read the first two issues (approximately&#8212;there are no markings to distinguish one issue from the next, so I&#8217;m guessing where the issues end and begin), and I&#8217;ve certainly read nothing that makes me think this story about a team of snotty, sexually charged adolescents violently rescuing the world&#8217;s deadliest assassin from a black ops military operation belongs in the same &#8216;all ages&#8217; line as the Gus Beezer comics. It&#8217;s not that I think kids <em>shouldn&#8217;t</em> be allowed to read stuff like <cite>Ultimate X-Men</cite>. I read <cite class="People">Stephen King</cite> novels when I was eleven years old, but I don&#8217;t think they ought to be sold in the children&#8217;s section of the bookstore.</p>
<p>Besides, doesn&#8217;t Mark Millar hate it when comics publishers censor his work?
