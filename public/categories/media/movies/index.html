<div class="text">
<p>I guess it was early April when <cite class="People">Steven</cite> I went to see <cite class="Movies">V for Vendetta</cite> and I managed to hold off on buzzing my hair until late May, though I&#8217;d wanted it well before I saw Natalie Portman pull it off. I don&#8217;t talk about fashion and haircuts just to be frivolous but because I think the movie&#8217;s frivolity is key. Back in the 80s when <cite class="Comics">V for Vendetta</cite> was written, dystopia looked dim. Recession would give way to civil war and ethnic cleansing (though that wasn&#8217;t a term yet, then, right? Not until the next decade and Yugoslavia&#8217;s demise?) and grim cement-block dormitories that would drive a girl right out on the streets to take a chance on prostitution when it could hardly be worse than home. Nowadays, I think we imagine it more like the movie does, although now the Fed&#8217;s this week stopped moving up interest rates, et c., et c., and who knows? But yeah, the &#8220;first they came for the Pakistanis and I didn&#8217;t speak up because I was too busy watching tv, plus don&#8217;t you have to be suspicious of them anyway?&#8221; approach seems like a plausible enough one to take. Unfortunately removing the squalor means removing some of the motivation. Here, Evey&#8217;s looking plenty fashionable by our standards and is sort of coddled by our fascist dictatorship, sure, but that&#8217;s what happens in the book too.</p>
<p>When Evey sets out from home at the start of the movie, she&#8217;s not exactly hoping to sell her body, or not so directly. She&#8217;s got a date with her boss (of some sort; like I said, it&#8217;s been months and the details are hazy) Gordon, who we later learn is gay and only dating girls for cover. Not only that, but he&#8217;s got a secret archive of Korans and Mapplethorpes. (I&#8217;m making that detail up because I don&#8217;t remember what the pictures of frolicking male nudes in the movie actually were, and because it lets me add the bitter footnote that I haven&#8217;t ever recovered from my anger that my parents wouldn&#8217;t let me see the Mapplethorpe exhibit that was subject of an obscenity trial here in Cincinnati. I listened to the details on the news every night and wanted to go judge for myself whether, as I suspected, the child nudes were in fact non-sexual and the adults appropriately so. Apparently the fact that I was 10 was enough to keep people from taking me seriously when it came to this request. I see their point, but, like I said, I still resent how it made me feel so left out, like history was passing me by.) So okay, it&#8217;s in Gordon&#8217;s best interests to have these beards so that he doesn&#8217;t raise enough eyebrows to get his place searched, but for that reason it&#8217;s in his best interest not to be encouraging young women with his business card from sneaking out after curfew to be caught and questioned by the secret police, so I don&#8217;t in fact think this was a good translation from book to screen, but it gets Evey out on the streets and lets V become her savior.</p>
<p>So the movie prettifies dystopia, but more interesting I think are the ways it erases some of the messiness around gender in the original. Here, when Evey&#8217;s thrust back into her corrupt world, she finds Gordon again to be her hero who&#8217;s keeping it real while living a lie. In the book, though, she lives with a rather different sort of character, a middle-aged man who wants her to share his bed. I think Steven thinks she&#8217;s legitimately fallen in love (whatever that means), but I think love isn&#8217;t even an issue at that point. She knows she&#8217;s nothing but a pawn and yet her body gives her an edge up, the only sort of power she can have. Living with V, like living under the tyranny outside, has taught her to comply with anything without protest, to easily  readjust her worldview to let her survive inside the new power structure. So Evey learns to live out there and she survives, and then gets pulled back into the secret world and survives there too. She&#8217;s really not a very exciting protagonist, although I think she&#8217;s supposed to be.</p>
<p>More interesting, at least in the book, is the character I found most sympathetic, Rosemary Almond. She doesn&#8217;t show up in the movie, like the other major woman among the minor characters, Helen Heyer. Dr. Delia is there, in about an equivalent role, and the mysterious martyred Valerie, but none of the women who actually act like women. Of course, in this world &#8220;acting like women&#8221; means they are able to create roles for themselves based on those of the men they&#8217;re married to or otherwise fucking or at least implying they&#8217;d be willing to consider fucking. Helen, whom I do find sympathetic and more interesting than V or Evey, is a conniving bitch who gets her comeuppance, but she&#8217;s also in some ways the only woman with any sense of agency we get to see in the story. Sure, Evey takes on a mantle, but that&#8217;s some mystical transformative thing and a necessary unbelievability if you want a hopeful future for humanity after the final page.</p>
<p>Rosemary, though, has something else going on. By my reading, she seems like the solidly middle-class wife of a civil servant who doesn&#8217;t appreciate her (claiming he&#8217;d want to fuck her if she were more like the glamorous Helen, excuses for erectile dysfunction being more than common in the book) and yet whom she loves and accepts as loving her as much as he can. Then he gets offed by V and she learns quickly that even her bitter husband provided for her better than the state will, and she eventually does decide it would be in her best interests to accede to the propositions of one of her dead husband&#8217;s friends since it&#8217;s the only way she can maintain the standard of living she barely wants. V eventually gets him, too, and poor Rosemary ends putting on makeup like Evey at the beginning of the book to become a chorus girl at the cabaret the political leaders (formerly her social set) frequent. Unwilling to accept such an ending, though, she buys a gun and shoots The Leader of the fascist regime. In the book she does, at least.</p>
<p>In the movie, there is no Rosemary. It&#8217;s V and his awesome fighting skillz that come into play in the Matrixy assassination sequence, no &#8220;hell hath no fury&#8221; sequence needed. And yet while they&#8217;ve written out this Evey-parallel character in making the translation, there&#8217;s more to the Evey parallel than I&#8217;ve already said. See, in the book when Evey learns about the trademark rose V leaves with his victims, she asks if there&#8217;s one for The Leader but V replies that he has a different rose for that job. By this part in the story, Rosemary has been going by Rose for quite some time, a switch that&#8217;s not botanically sound but does sometimes seem to happen in namings though I&#8217;m rather particular about being a Rose plain, and now we learn that instead of being a woman out for vengeance and truth and power, she&#8217;s just another domino. In the most charitable reading, perhaps V&#8217;s just kept up with his surveillance and happens to know what she&#8217;ll do, but that hardly seems like him, does it? No, Rosemary/Rose is just like Evey, who&#8217;s guilted and manipulated into becoming exactly the woman V wanted her to be, giving him his perfect send off. Each has her heart ripped out by V until she can learn to be violent in a way that&#8217;s useful to him and his precious cause.</p>
<p>None of this is to say that I don&#8217;t sympathize with V, don&#8217;t think an evil, racist, fascist, misogynist government shouldn&#8217;t be overthrown. It&#8217;s just a bit creepy, if honest, to show the sexist, megalomaniacal tactics he uses to do that in the book. It&#8217;s equally creepy, I find, to edit that out in adapting it to movie form. While the movie avoids the &#8220;Evey, I am your father!&#8221; scene for seduction, neither story has much to show about truthful or healthy relationships, which I suppose is a rather obvious statement. It&#8217;s hard for me to watch Evey being abused even when V&#8217;s on good behavior and not locking her up with a rat for company. It&#8217;s hard to watch Rosemary pull a trigger that she  knows will ruin her life with the hope that it might save others, though harder still with the thought that she&#8217;s just doing this for V and only thinks it&#8217;s for herself. But maybe all I&#8217;m saying is it&#8217;s just hard to sympathize with a crazy fascist who wants to overcome crazy fascism. There&#8217;s got to be a better way and I hope we find it soon.

<p><cite class="People">Steven</cite> and I saw <cite class="Movies">A Scanner Darkly</cite> 10 days or so ago and then I read the book on Saturday. I have a lot to say about them, but I&#8217;ve already written <a href="http://brododaktula.livejournal.com/9102.html">a version of this post</a> on <a href="http://brododaktula.livejournal.com/">the livejournal I&#8217;ve been keeping</a>. I want it here because it&#8217;s more this kind of material than what I&#8217;ve been writing there and also because I have very similar things to say about <cite class="Comics">V for Vendetta</cite> and it will be easier to say them if I can just link back here. </p>
<p><em>&#8220;Everybody bangs me.&#8221; She amended that. &#8220;Tries to, anyhow. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s like to be a chick.&#8221;</em> (14)</p>
<p>So I read <cite class="Books">A Scanner Darkly</cite> on Saturday and watched the adaptation the weekend before, and Steven was right that it was a remarkably faithful adaptation (and I&#8217;m sure I never doubted him!). Sure, the movie&#8217;s been beefed up with more foreshadowing (possibly, as Steven suggested to me, because some of the twists were things Dick made up as he went along) and a few nods to the fact that it&#8217;s being released in 2006, not the late 70s. So instead of phone booths there are cellphones. There&#8217;s no word about a Communist conspiracy, but there&#8217;s also no real surprise in Big Government colluding with Big Business.</p>
<p>Most interesting to me, though, is that while the movie is still about ostensibly straight, white men, that almost doesn&#8217;t matter. Sure, as in the book, there&#8217;s debate about how to get into Donna&#8217;s pants and why Bob can&#8217;t manage to do it. As in the novel, when Bob brings home a Donna-substitute to fuck, she wants to know whether he&#8217;s gay since he lives with two men. As in the novel, he tells her that he&#8217;s trying not to be. But there&#8217;s none of the hand-wringing about how Donna&#8217;s not going to be able to preserve her current chastity because chicks never do. In fact, in no time at all women addicts seem to slip right into selling sex for drugs. Somehow the men are able to avoid this or avoid mention at least. In the movie, it doesn&#8217;t come up much, in part because women don&#8217;t exist much.</p>
<p>In the whole movie, I don&#8217;t remember hearing once about a woman who wasn&#8217;t wearing a bra, but that&#8217;s a key descriptor for certainly the vast majority of the women who show up in the book. And while race seems quite incidental in the movie, that these just happen to be a bunch of white stoners, race has in many parts been erased. It&#8217;s supposed to be black people from whom Barris buys the bike and a black man who explains to them how the gears actually work, but that&#8217;s not how it works out in the movie. The only black character I remember (and I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m forgetting some) from the movie is the doctor in the team examining Bob/Fred, and she&#8217;s female too. So instead of getting to see how privilege works, why these hierarchical distinctions maybe matter even more to these paranoid straight, white male addicts because inherent power is the only kind of power they can get, we get to see a black woman as the voice of reason, able to correctly assess what&#8217;s wrong with Bob. I&#8217;m not sure if this was a deliberate choice to contrast the novel&#8217;s stance (and I&#8217;m not accusing Dick of being a misogynist racist or anything; I assume the biases he gives Bob/Fred and his cohort are just the sort they&#8217;d really have) or if it&#8217;s a way of supporting it, showing that non-white/female power is just another thing Bob&#8217;s damaged brain can&#8217;t handle.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more to it than that, of course. This doctor is the one who tells Bob to get Donna some little blue (in the movie version, at least, blue) flowers, which initially made me suspect that she might be Donna in some sort of higher-level scramble suit. She&#8217;s the one who lets him off the hook the first time he should fail his perception tests, also the sort of thing a kind-hearted or manipulative girlfriend might do. And yet it eventually turns out that maybe she&#8217;s gotten through to Bob&#8217;s reptile brain and, whether he realizes it or not, he may do exactly what she asks. Would a white man higher up the hierarchy have been able to get below his skin as well? Beats me.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s the whole Donna conundrum, too, that while in the movie she doesn&#8217;t get to be the castrating bitch who&#8217;s suing a man for $40,000 for grabbing her boob and who carries a well-concealed knife to ward off potential attackers, she gets a major elevation of role in the metaplot. Whether this makes her a conniving bitch instead, especially since as in the book there&#8217;s a decent chance that she&#8217;s disguised herself as Connie to be Bob&#8217;s Donna-substitute fuck after she&#8217;s turned him down as Donna, is unclear. I&#8217;m pretty sure there was a major difference in the scene where she does turn him down, when Bob asks if he can run away with her if she cleans up her life and leaves the scene, too. In the book, this refusal more than her unwillingness to have sex was the heartbreaking dealbreaker for him. He can&#8217;t even have a fantasy of her. And yet I&#8217;d thought in the movie she agreed that sure, maybe they&#8217;d go together and thus he could dream whatever he wanted (while she knew the truth). I feel a lot of tenderness for her in both versions, maybe gender biases coming into play again, but she&#8217;s a bit of a mystery no matter what. I think that&#8217;s a good thing, though.</p>
<p>Really, I said that I was okay with not having all the plotlines completely resolved and I still am. I like a certain amount of uncertainty (ha ha) but there&#8217;s something a bit unnerving about the cleanup of the nastier bits of story for the movie, just as there would be something unnerving about hearing <cite class="People">Keanu Reeves</cite> call someone a &#8220;spade&#8221; the way he&#8217;d have to in a literal adaptation. I don&#8217;t know how this sort of thing generally does or should get dealt with, but it&#8217;s still got me thinking days later. I just don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m thinking toward definitives, which is typical but also probably good.

<p>So I&#8217;m definitely not back to regular blogging&#8212;OK, I&#8217;ve never managed to blog very regularly, but anyway, I&#8217;m definitely not prepared even for monthly blogging at this point. We&#8217;ll have to see how it goes when my semester ends in a couple weeks. In the meantime, I&#8217;ve decided to join the world of <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html">Web 2.0</a> and start participating in <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/steven-berg/">Flickr</a> (see also <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/rose-and-steven/">the <strong>rose and steven</strong> group</a>) and <a href="http://del.icio.us/steven.berg">del.icio.us</a>. So far I&#8217;ve only uploaded <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/steven-berg/sets/72057594109610194/">the photos from our trip to New Orleans</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/steven-berg/sets/72057594110994714/">many photos of our pet cat</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>As long as I&#8217;m writing, I might as well write a little more. I think the only movie other than <a href="../../../archives/2006/03/02/ummmm"><cite class="Movies">Brokeback Mountain</cite></a> that Rose and I have seen in a theater this year is <cite class="Movies">V for Vendetta</cite>. Oh, no, we also saw <cite class="Movies">Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story</cite>. I need to read <cite class="People">Laurence Sterne</cite>&#8217;s novel so I can understand how it works as an adaptation, but it works well standing alone too. As far as this kind of movie goes, I think it&#8217;s more frivolous than <cite class="Movies">8½</cite> and probably less frivolous than <cite class="Movies">Adaptation</cite>.</p>
<p>But <cite>V for Vendetta</cite>. We weren&#8217;t initially planning to see it, because it looked pretty stupid. But <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2006_03_01_archive.asp#114258572436494811"><cite class="People">William Gibson</cite> recommended it</a> and <a href="http://sweet-nothing.livejournal.com/"><cite class="People">John Pistelli</cite> at Maxims and Reflections</a> had a whole series of entertaining posts (<a href="http://sweet-nothing.livejournal.com/2842.html">&#8220;Ideas are Bulletproof,&#8221;</a> <a href="http://sweet-nothing.livejournal.com/3113.html">&#8220;Re-review,&#8221;</a> <a href="http://sweet-nothing.livejournal.com/3367.html">&#8220;Brands are Ideaproof,&#8221;</a> <a href="http://sweet-nothing.livejournal.com/4479.html">&#8220;A Shamanic Soldier Priest&#8221;</a> [tangentially related]) that really made me want to see the movie. So I did. Twice, in fact: once on my own because Rose was otherwise occupied and then again with Rose. I think <cite class="People">Alan Moore</cite>&#8217;s book doesn&#8217;t translate well to cinema&#8212;it might have worked better as a much longer movie or a miniseries. It needs an ensemble cast and time to develop several protagonists. The movie jettisons pretty much everything from the book except V&#8217;s story and follows a more conventional heroic adventure format that misses much of the book&#8217;s political sophistication. I guess Evey&#8217;s story is largely intact, especially her imprisonment, but it suffers in comparison with Evey&#8217;s story in the book. Movie Evey is older than Book Evey, and this allows her to be less dependent on V. But the filmmakers replace Book V and Book Evey&#8217;s coercive power-imbalanced relationship with a more conventional romantic subplot that appears unexpectedly and arbitrarily near the end of the movie. (I certainly wasn&#8217;t expecting that kiss, anyway.) I prefer the movie&#8217;s less Stockholm Syndrome-esque version of Evey&#8217;s escape from prison, but I prefer the book&#8217;s less sentimental version of Evey&#8217;s final crisis and climax after V&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>Other <cite class="Comics">V for Vendetta</cite> thoughts, maybe for writing about in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>The prologue and epilogue with Evey admonishing the viewer that the man is more important than the man&#8217;s ideas: why do the filmmakers undermine V&#8217;s claim that ideas are bulletproof?</li>
<li>The surprising prosperity and invisibility of class and poverty in this fascist dystopia which lost at least several tens of thousands people from its population to plague and genocide, in a world where the U.S.A. has disintegrated into civil war and the Middle East has presumably done the same or been destroyed entirely. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s U.S. culture&#8217;s typical blindness to economic inequality&#8212;everybody&#8217;s middle class in TV land&#8212;but it seems especially egregious in such a political polemical movie.</li>

<p>our cat&#8217;s first year of participation in <a href="http://milogeorge.blogspot.com/2005/04/happy-international-record-your-cat.html">International Record Your Cat Reacting to <cite class="Movies">2001: A Space Odyssey</cite> Day</a>, although given her age it&#8217;s also her first year of eligibility. </p>
<p>Saffron is decidedly not a fan. The music creeped her out and she wouldn&#8217;t go near the screen unless, as in the photo, <cite class="People">Steven</cite> forced her to look while I snapped a photo. She seems to have recovered well and is sleeping happily on my feet now, so at least this story has a happy and easily comprehensible ending.

<p>Ah, not blogging is fun. Maybe blogging can be fun too?</p>
<p>Um, but what to blog about? Rose and I saw <cite class="Movies">Brokeback Mountain</cite> a few days ago. <cite class="People">Jake Gyllenhaal</cite> and <cite class="People">Heath Ledger</cite> are so brave! Fah.</p>
<p>I was going to mention how it&#8217;s not exactly a universal love story, since people whose love doesn&#8217;t deviate from normative restrictions aren&#8217;t encouraged to fear and despise themselves, aren&#8217;t murdered for the crime of existing or driven into a traumatized unlife in the closet. Then I read the <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18712"><cite class="Magazines">New York Review of Books</cite> review</a>, so I&#8217;ll just link to that instead. Because I&#8217;m lazy.</p>
<p>I will say this: universality is overrated. Universal themes: who cares? They&#8217;re generic, we&#8217;ve seen them a million times before. The specificity is what makes stories worth reading! And the specificity is especially important in <cite>Brokeback Mountain</cite>, where <a href="http://www.godhatesfags.com/">the specific story is real and happening right now</a>. There are people&#8212;maybe not as many as there used to be, but still far too many&#8212;who would watch <cite>Brokeback Mountain</cite> and rejoice in Jack and Ennis&#8217;s misery. (They&#8217;d probably be sad about the broken marriages, though.) There are many men who won&#8217;t see the movie because they fear the image of gay sex. That&#8217;s what the story&#8217;s about: denial, hatred and fear of sexuality, a man who can&#8217;t overcome his fear and kills his own soul as thoroughly as other fearful men kill his would-be lover.</p>
<p>I just thought of something. Did anybody praise <cite class="People">Liam Neeson</cite> and <cite class="People">Peter Sarsgaard</cite> for playing bisexual in <cite class="Movies">Kinsey</cite>?</p>

I was gonna say the little girls are being denied their veiled bondage quasi-porn, but it occurred to me they they must be getting <em>plenty</em> of that in their manga.</p>

<p>Since I did a health update last time, I&#8217;ll add now that apparently the reason I&#8217;ve felt yucky the whole last month is pneumonia, but I&#8217;m on a new antibiotic that seems to be turning things around. Still, expect a certain amount of radio silence.</p>
<p>We did go see <cite class="Movies">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</cite> a week or two ago. <cite class="People">Steven</cite> had read the books in middle school or so, but I got to them much earlier, which I think is why they stuck so deep in me. In kindergarten, I could recite full pages from <cite class="People">C.S. Lewis</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Books">The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</cite> because I spent so much time poring over it and making sure my pictures of Mr. Tumnus and Lucy matched the descriptions. I&#8217;ve probably read it and my very favorite, <cite class="Books">The Voyage of The Dawn Treader</cite> 50+ times, if not far more than that. But I hadn&#8217;t read them recently, not since middle school or so for me, when I moved from believing that even if I Jesus made no sense to me I could understand the power of Aslan to deciding that it was all just stories and I was ready to read something new.  After the movie, though, I decided to give them another shot. I was reading a book a night last week (in publication chronology) but I seem to have tapered off after <cite class="Books">The Silver Chair</cite>, since I know in my old opinion it was all downhill from there, especially into <cite class="Books">The Last Battle</cite>. </p>
<p>See, that&#8217;s where the gender problems get inescapable, or so it seemed to me. The Pevensie children are thrust into Narnia again because they&#8217;re dying on earth, but sister Susan is no longer with them. See, she&#8217;s now more interested in boys and stockings and lipstick than in the Narnian ideals of righteousness and stuff. (Here and throughout quotes are paraphrased, but correct to the best of my memory. Again, I plead sick and don&#8217;t want to have to flip through all those pages.) Apparently so much for &#8220;once a king or queen in Narnia, always a king or queen in Narnia&#8221; when it comes to getting one last chance! I think it especially bothered me because in the setup to <cite>Dawn Treader</cite> it&#8217;s explained that Susan gets to accompany their parents to America because she&#8217;s pretty and not as smart as the other children and thus will gain more from the experience. See, that always bothered me. Shouldn&#8217;t Aslan grade on a curve if this is what we already know Susan&#8217;s like? That&#8217;s all the explanation there is, though, and that always nagged at me even though I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve ever cared about lipstick or stockings or boys. </p>
<p>Nothing before that seemed too bad, though it was there. Father Christmas tells the girls in the first book that wars are ugly when women fight. Then there&#8217;s Eustace&#8217;s teetotaler, vegetarian parents in <cite>Dawn Treader</cite>, with his mother particularly singled out for being disappointed when he comes back from Narnia, where he&#8217;s had life-changing experiences, because now he&#8217;s just like an ordinary boy. In the ridiculous liberal parody school, Experiment House, that Jill and Eustace attend in <cite class="Books">The Silver Chair</cite>, the head of schools who allows bullying to go on in order to study bullies turns out in the last pages to be (<i>gasp!</i>) a woman, although she&#8217;s eventually shuffled off to Parliament where she won&#8217;t have any more negative effects on anyone. Maybe it&#8217;s because these books have been part of my life since before I could read that this comes across as more a cranky old uncle-figure complaining about kids (and schools) these days. I didn&#8217;t agree, but I found it easier to ignore those bits and focus on the parts I found less off-putting.</p>
<p>What I did find more off-putting was the way the movie dealt with such issues. This is very much Lucy&#8217;s story and there&#8217;s a reason, in Lewis&#8217;s rigid gender system, that this is a book dedicated to a young girl. It&#8217;s not really about the epic battle sequences, although I may just be saying this because they do nothing for me. More important are the personal transformations the children all go through in their adventure, and unfortunately if you&#8217;re going to have exciting times hiding from the wolves, you don&#8217;t have time for all that. It just seemed unbalanced to me, in a story about children thrown into a situation where they have to become adults, to depict this almost purely by how nobly they toss their heads when sparring or doing archery practice. And that&#8217;s not even mentioning the things the movie added. Now Mr. and Mrs. Beaver suddenly play out the smart mom/doofus dad dynamic common in bad sitcoms, and I don&#8217;t think talking animals had to be funny in quite the modern way they were. I don&#8217;t think the Susan/Peter dynamic was expressed well enough in the movie, either; they weren&#8217;t trying to be mom and dad, just to be leaders to the other children as best they could and with varying ideas about what would be best. Father Christmas&#8217;s line about why he doesn&#8217;t want Lucy and Susan to fight unless they absolutely must gets cleaned up, but then Peter forces Edmund to wear a woman&#8217;s coat, because nothing&#8217;s more humiliating than being like a <i>girl</i>! Ah, how times have changed in these 60 years!</p>
<p>This is all leaving aside the question of whether there&#8217;s a crypto-Christian story playing, which is certainly what Christian groups are being told. I&#8217;m not so sure. Yeah, Aslan sacrifices himself and then shows up again, but I think there&#8217;s more to Jesus than that. What we don&#8217;t hear until the very end of the movie is the refrain that runs through the book, <em>Aslan is not a tame lion</em>. The actors did their best to portray the awesomeness (in both the grand and terrifying sense) of the Great Lion, but the movie didn&#8217;t really bother with that. Weirder still is that only Aslan has to make meaningful sacrifices, and all his scarier moments are removed so that he can look better gilded. In one of my favorite scenes in the book, Lucy comes upon her dying brother Edmund as the battle is winding down and she gives him a drop of her healing fire flower potion. For a long, dreadful moment, nothing happens. Then Aslan tells her that she needs to move on to others, and she basically shushes him. He points out (loudly) that others may be dying because of her selfishness and at that she leaps up apologetically and heads out on her task. Edmund&#8217;s stern talking-to when he&#8217;s returned to Aslan&#8217;s camp is fiercer, too, as is the admonition that Peter needs to clean his sword. Maybe there are a lot of Christians who think that individuals don&#8217;t matter in the face of a god whose sacrifice has changed everything, but I&#8217;m pretty sure most of them go in for the &#8220;doing good works&#8221; side of things too. That&#8217;s the part, not the deeper magic from before the dawn of time, that seems compelling to me as a reader, though not as a viewer since it&#8217;s hardly anywhere to be seen.</p>
<p>I complained a little about the battle already and I&#8217;m sure in the post-<cite class="Movies">Lord of the Rings</cite> era we&#8217;re going to get many such showdowns, but this one struck me as almost dull. Again, it&#8217;s partly because the girls are absent. In the book, it&#8217;s the battle that&#8217;s left in the background (a sign that Lewis/Aslan now trust Edmund and Peter to play their roles without oversight?) with the waking of the statues as the key plot point. I loved the scene with Giant Rumblebuffin (not in the least because it brings back Lucy&#8217;s handkerchief a third time) and the little Christmas diners and the moment when Lucy finds the stone Mr. Tumnus in a niche upstairs and the other lion who leaps around telling everyone about his brotherhood with Aslan, who speaks of &#8220;us lions.&#8221; This is drama! This is weeping giants and a reminder that a battle isn&#8217;t decided only by those on the front lines (again, I think, a nod toward the Christians). Instead what we got were vaguely realistic falling rocks and charging polar bears, which I&#8217;m sure thrilled and excited plenty of viewers but seemed to me to be missing something. As becomes clearer in later books, part of what makes Narnia special is the talking animals, the naiads and dryads and so on. Should the moment of Narnian glory really be represented as one long beastly roar? Sure, we need to see Edmund go for the Witch&#8217;s wand rather than her head, but I really don&#8217;t care about in what order the centaurs went forth, and the archers and so on.</p>
<p>Then there was the Witch herself, who seemed to me pure sex almost to the point of overkill. She seemed scary because she was so weird, not because she was cold and dangerous. Sure, she would have killed Edmund, but even the moment she slaughters Aslan didn&#8217;t seem as intense and final as I thought it should have been. There wasn&#8217;t really the primal darkness I wanted to see, just the sense that she had an army of clones without personalities behind her willing to heed her every command. Maybe that&#8217;s a place where no movie could touch imagination, but it seemed the onset of spring melted her too instead of leaving her flushed with fury and desperate power.</p>
<p>This is not to say I didn&#8217;t enjoy the movie. I thought it was a lot of fun, and the 6 or so children sitting behind us (much quieter than their parents) seemed to enjoy it too. I told Steven just before the movie started, &#8220;Knit bloggers are trying to figure out how to make Lucy&#8217;s sweater, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll want to do that.&#8221; I was so, so wrong.

<div class="text">
<p>Today I was thinking about a conference I attended as an undergrad, <a href="http://www.cwru.edu/artsci/bakernord/aristophanes/program.html">Performing Aristophanes</a>. I really miss going to conferences and lectures and talking to visiting professors, but that&#8217;s not really the point. What I was thinking about was how difficult it is to translate humor. How can I make a joke that was relevant nearly 2500 years ago funny now while still leaving it in some way intact? What&#8217;s cultural-specific and what&#8217;s universal? This is something I think about a lot when reading manga, and I wish more manga translators/adapters kept blogs themselves, because I&#8217;d love to hear about the process.</p>
<p>I have a few examples, though I&#8217;m not going to be a good enough blogger to look up the page numbers or anything like that. In the first volume of <cite class="Comics">Genshiken</cite>, the club welcomes a new <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">otaku</i> member with the chant, &#8220;One of us, one of us, one of us.&#8221; Is this because there&#8217;s a big Japanese market for <cite class="Movies">Freaks</cite> or was there something else there originally? Since Japanese isn&#8217;t even on my list of languages to learn, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be finding out. Then there was, I think, the first volume of <cite class="Comics">.hack//Legend of the Twilight</cite>, in which the main character, Shugo, was told he wasn&#8217;t even qualified to be an &#8220;assistant pig-keeper&#8221; in the online roleplaying game he was entering. Is this a Japanese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Prydain"><cite class="People">Lloyd Alexander</cite></a> shout out or is the translator remembering his (the Tokyopop site doesn&#8217;t list any names, but I remember blaming <cite class="People">Jake Forbes</cite>, perhaps unfairly) own childhood favorites?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more than this, though. When the character called Osaka, after the town where she most recently lived, talks like she should be on <cite class="Television">The Sopranos</cite> in <cite class="Comics">Azumanga Daioh</cite>, is this to denote class and ethnicity or could it be any funny accent? When the Chinese student in <cite class="Comics">Negima</cite> uses pidgin English (presumably originally Japanese) I do feel kind of awkward about it because I can&#8217;t evaluate the extent to which she&#8217;s playing on ugly stereotypes. (And in that case I&#8217;m tending to believe that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on, given that apparently <cite class="People">Ken Akamatsu</cite>&#8217;s more famous book, <cite class="Comics">Love Hina</cite>, features some sort of fictionalized Polynesian girl who is also a sort of ingenue/airhead figure.)</p>
<p>So how do you translate culture and context and depth? I was left wondering about this when we saw <cite class="Movies">Syriana</cite> last weekend. I didn&#8217;t find the plot confusing, but was fascinated by some of the language choices. As far as I can tell, the considerable foreign language portions were under-translated (Farsi, Arabic, Urdu, French that I recall), perhaps because American audiences can&#8217;t keep up with long subtitles. You can tell that when a long string of text doesn&#8217;t lead to correspondingly long translations, something may be up, but I noticed something even more striking. At one point as Wasim, a young Pakistani man who has been working as a day laborer in the fictitious Persian Gulf state where much of the action takes place, is being pulled on a radical Islamic path in the madrasa he attends, the man instructing him and his friends goes on a tirade about how, basically, globalization is not solving the problems of modern life. I&#8217;m trying to phrase this so that I&#8217;m not paraphrasing the Islamist slogan &#8220;Islam is the answer,&#8221; but I do think that&#8217;s left implicit in the teacher&#8217;s repetition of &#8220;Qur&#8217;an&#8221; as a counterpoint to everything that isn&#8217;t making the students&#8217; lives easier. And then he says something that is rendered as (more or less, because I know I don&#8217;t remember the predicate of the sentence, though I do know the subject), &#8220;The Christian world doesn&#8217;t help you.&#8221; But he didn&#8217;t say &#8220;the Christian world,&#8221; or at least didn&#8217;t exactly say it. He said &#8220;<i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">al-Harb</i>,&#8221; meaning &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dar_al-harb"><i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">Dar al-Harb</i></a>, the house of war. He&#8217;s saying in much stronger terms than just breaking the world into Muslim and Christian spheres of influence that there&#8217;s a war going on and there are sides to be chosen, that the dichotomy is real and comprehensible. It was strong enough that it grabbed me in the theater and I elbowed <cite class="People">Steven</cite> and told him to bother me later for details, but I wonder whether the language was strong enough for other viewers who didn&#8217;t know even enough Arabic to notice this. Obviously they still knew that Wasim was being wooed into a system where he was still a pawn, but well-fed and literate, Arabic-speaking. They understood that this was a lecture about the state of the world and the imperative the teacher felt for his brand of Islam, but is it only because they knew what kind of movie this was and because of the America we live in that they could tell what brand that was, know that there was a war on?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how to answer questions like that. You can call this a <a href="http://chutry.wordherders.net/archives/005240.html">hypertext movie</a>, but in hypertext there are more links, you can keep another tab in your browser open to google what you don&#8217;t understand. It doesn&#8217;t really work like that if what you don&#8217;t understand is in Farsi, because where do you start? How do you know?</p>
<p>Maybe <cite>Syriana</cite> is more interesting to people like me who already ask questions like that, who appreciate the necessity of incompleteness in communication. Certainly it may resonate better with others like me who will recognize that its corporatespeak is awfully close to the real thing, or those who pick up on more religious references than I do, or people who know more about the flow of oil and LNG. For me, though, it worked as a movie and as a parable of sorts about corruption and complicity.  I was able to tell the characters apart even though they were virtually all men (an ongoing problem) and I think the complexity of the plot was overrated by a lot of the critics I read. However, as I&#8217;ve commented, the complexity in the story was perhaps more than I can know.

<p><cite class="People">Steven</cite> and I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0414387/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnx0dD0xfGZiPXV8cG49MHxrdz0xfHE9cHJpZGUgJiBwcmVqdWRpY2V8ZnQ9MXxteD0yMHxsbT01MDB8Y289MXxodG1sPTF8bm09MQ__;fc=2;ft=20;fm=1"><cite class="Movies">Pride &#038; Prejudice</cite></a> a few weeks ago now, I suppose, although I&#8217;d watched it on my own a week before that and I finished rereading the book this weekend. I&#8217;d read it first when I was 10 or so and it seemed so alien, less because of the social machinations than the love, I suspect.  I may not understand what love feels like now, but certainly didn&#8217;t then when I expected I&#8217;d grow up to be a writer who lived alone with cats and perhaps foster children. The joke&#8217;s on me, I suppose, since everyone who&#8217;s dropped by here has seen how much writing I do, though at least there is now a cat.</p>
<p>At any rate, before seeing the movie or embarking on the novel again, I&#8217;d read <cite class="People">Rachel Hartman</cite>&#8217;s lovely posts about <a href="http://www.webamused.com/milkbreath/archives/002587.html">the place of Romanticism</a> and <a href="http://www.webamused.com/milkbreath/archives/002595.html">her detailed thoughts post-viewing</a>.  I haven&#8217;t seen any of the other <cite class="Books">Pride and Prejudice</cite> adaptations and don&#8217;t imagine I will. (The much-beloved <cite class="People">Colin Firth</cite> seemed like such a square-headed, lumpy creep in <cite class="Movies">Love Actually</cite> and made no impression in the dreadful recent <cite class="Movies">The Importance of Being Earnest</cite>, the only two times I&#8217;ve ever seen him.) Oh, and I have to add that the North American ending wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if there weren&#8217;t dialogue, but there decidedly is. Ack.</p>
<p>Where I&#8217;m going with this is that in Rachel&#8217;s second post she complained about some of the goofy, sappy choices in the movie, particularly when Lizzy and Darcy are dancing and all of a sudden <em>ooooh, they&#8217;re the only couple in the room</em>. And when you put it like that, yes, gag, but I was going to argue it&#8217;s something I&#8217;d accept in <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">sh&ocirc;jo</i> manga and that&#8217;s why I allowed it here. It&#8217;s been a progress for me, first allowing superheroes to work as metaphors for mundane life, then learning to see the angry scowls in <cite class="Comics">Nana</cite> as perfectly normal and understandable, finally ending up not minding in my movie romances when the scene ends as the heroine blows out her candle. And while there&#8217;s probably something to the argument that <a href="http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/002513.html"><cite>Pride &#038; Prejudice</cite> is a Bollywood film</a>, I think I&#8217;d have been on equally strong ground explaining that it&#8217;s got <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">sh&ocirc;jo</i>  elements, moments when emotions get so strong they skew reality. But then I remember that before I called that <i lang="ja" xml:lang="ja">sh&ocirc;jo</i>  I called it focalization.</p>
<p>Rachel touches on this, too, that in the book (and, apparently, prior conversions to film) when Lizzy meets Darcy again after having rejected his unexpected offer of marriage (in part because she&#8217;d found him insufferably self-absorbed and antisocial) only to find him a changed man, open, generous, shy. It seems that many readers want this moment, want to see that love has changed Darcy, and that&#8217;s not quite there in this current version. While I wouldn&#8217;t say that&#8217;s not the case in the novel, what&#8217;s more apparent to me is that love has changed Lizzy and that she&#8217;s the focalized(/focalizing) character. While it&#8217;s not a first-person book, much of what we see is swayed by her eyes, which is part of the reason her father is a fuller character even though her mother gets more &#8220;airtime.&#8221; While the movie uses an even more distant third-person setup, I think the effect is the same. We get to see one of Lizzy&#8217;s dreams, including the reddish look of light from within her closed eyes, but less literal is the way the world melts away when she and Darcy dance or becomes an unchanging cage when she has rejected his love. If I were still 10, this might bother me because I&#8217;d doubt love was like that. I do doubt that a bit, I guess, but I think life is like that, with moments of excitement or pain we capture and turn into metaphors, and I thought the movie handled it beautifully.</p>
<p>And after all that is it still important to note that I covet Lizzy&#8217;s coats? I like <cite class="People">Keira Knightley</cite> to begin with and I did believe her as Lizzy, giggles and raised eyebrows and lewd stares at nude statues&#8217; privy parts and all. And while I don&#8217;t look the least bit like her and probably couldn&#8217;t pull it off, I keep hoping this is going to jump-start some sort of fashion trend and those boots and coats will be readily available (and maybe not too popular so they&#8217;ll end up on clearance and I can buy them myself). Then you could draw me with tiny dot eyes and a huge, huge smile.

<p>You&#8217;ve presumably noticed by now that we have a new design. We also have an <a href="../../../about/index.html">about page</a> where you can learn many fascinating things about us, primarily via internet quiz results. We&#8217;ve also switched to a new host, so apologies if you ran into one of our bumps as we moved the site from our old host; hopefully most of them have been taken care of by now.</p>
<p>I was supposed to write about the movie <a title='One of my previous posts on the Philip K. Dick short story "Minority Report"' href="../../../archives/2005/06/18/anderton-vs-anderton"><cite class="Movies">Minority Report</cite></a> quite a while ago, but I never got around to it. I got the DVD from <a href="http://netflix.com/">Netflix</a>, but every time I had an opportunity to watch it I just didn&#8217;t want to spend the time. What really put me off the movie was <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/commonplacebook/95887.html">the advertising</a>. I mean, obviously Spielberg and co. play both sides, presenting horribly intrusive advertising as satire while collecting product-placement cash, so I found <cite>Minority Report</cite>&#8217;s satirical strength a little shaky to begin with. But <a title='Interactive Ads Play Big Role in "Minority Report"' href="http://www.clickz.com/news/article.php/1369861">this article</a>&#8212;blecch. I&#8217;m disturbed by a lot of advertising <em>right now</em> and the future advertising on display in <cite>Minority Report</cite> is outright evil, so reading the creative director of the ads in the movie assuring me that advertisers will figure out how to make their ads so intrusive that I won&#8217;t be able to avoid them puts me right off wanting to watch the movie.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m definitely not burned out on <cite class="Movies">Mulholland Dr.</cite>, especially the good discussion on <a href="../../../archives/2005/07/20/last-weeks-entertainment-3">Peiratikos</a> and <a href="http://www.ynot.motime.com/1121953140#475716">Motime Like the Present</a> to respond to. Um, but not quite yet&#8230;.</p>
<p>Actually, one thing. <cite class="People">David Fiore</cite>, in the Motime post I linked to, makes a good point about the conspiracy in the second part of the movie. Diane&#8217;s world is a full of conspirators against her as Rita&#8217;s is; the difference is that Diane sees her conspirators everywhere and nobody ever sees Rita&#8217;s conspirators. And moreover, as David says, there is no &#8220;backstage&#8221; in Diane&#8217;s world&#8212;there&#8217;s nothing outside of Diane&#8217;s sphere of experience and influence.</p>
<p>Does that connect in interesting ways to my consideration of &#8220;obvious fakes&#8221; and &#8220;seamless forgeries&#8221;? Maybe, maybe not? Both conspiracies seem fantastic and implausible. Rita&#8217;s conspiracy seems more real, since it exists independently of observation (except for its own observation), but it is nevertheless the subjective invention of a dreaming mind.

<h3>What I Watched</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0166924/"><cite class="Movies">Mulholland Dr.</cite></a>, <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000186/"><cite class="People">David Lynch</cite></a>:</strong> I only recently discovered Lynch&#8217;s ten clues&#8212;or, actually, I might have seen them before and forgotten about them. Here they are (from <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulholland_Dr.">&#8220;Mulholland Dr.&#8221;</a> on <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay particular attention in the beginning of the film: at least two clues are revealed before the credits.</li>
<li>Notice appearances of the red lampshade.</li>
<li>Can you hear the title of the film that Adam Kesher is auditioning actresses for? Is it mentioned again?</li>
<li>An accident is a terrible event&#8230;notice the location of the accident.</li>
<li>Who gives a key, and why?</li>
<li>Notice the robe, the ashtray, the coffee cup.</li>
<li>What is felt, realized and gathered at the club Silencio?</li>
<li>Did talent alone help Camilla?</li>
<li>Notice the occurrences surrounding the man behind Winkies.</li>
<li>Where is Aunt Ruth?</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&#8217;t take then time to figure out all the clues, but some of them are pretty easy: one of the clues before the credits is the first-person-perspective shot of somebody lying down to sleep; the red lampshade appears first next to the phone that isn&#8217;t answered in the sequence of phone calls between the conspirators against Rita, and later when Diane receives the phone call from Camilla about the party; Adam Kesher is auditioning actresses for <cite>The Sylvia North Story</cite>, which is the film where Diane and Camilla met; Rita&#8217;s accident is at the same place Camilla meets Diane to bring her to the party; etc. The most common interpretation of the movie seems to be that the first part (before the cowboy tells Diane to wake up) is Diane&#8217;s dream after learning that the hit man she hired has killed Camilla, and the second part is Diane&#8217;s descent to insanity mixed with memories or hallucinations of events leading up to her decision to have Camilla killed. Many of Lynch&#8217;s clues do suggest this interpretation, but I but I&#8217;ve never been convinced. The second part seems more believable&#8212;not only because <a href="http://www.ynot.motime.com/1099670390#369550">&#8220;there&#8217;s an overwhelming tendency, amongst critics and other analytical folk, to privilege the &#8217;sordid&#8217; over the &#8217;sentimental&#8217;&#8221;</a> but also because it doesn&#8217;t have strange conspirators controlling everything behind the scenes&#8212;of course, the conspirators are all still there, but they&#8217;re presumably regular folks whom Diane incorporates into her fantasies. But does verisimilitude have any place in a movie like this?</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the man behind Winkies, Silencio, the blue key and the blue box. In <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1110254700#427376">one of the comments threads</a> for one of <cite class="People">David Fiore</cite>&#8217;s many posts on <cite>Mulholland Dr.</cite> at <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/">Motime like the Present</a>, a fellow named Charles points out something about Silencio I hadn&#8217;t known:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Lynch plays on an old joke of his, and one of his most memorable scenes, by doing himself one better: he has del Rio playing herself, lipsyncing to her own song, a Spanish cover of Orbison. This joke loses much of its humor if (1) you fail to recognize the reality of del Rio, an actual person, (2) its connection to the very real oeuvre of Lynch and (3) how its reality might differ from the rest of the film.</p></blockquote>
<p><cite>Mulholland Dr.</cite> is actually the only Lynch movie I&#8217;ve seen, so I can&#8217;t follow the joke (it&#8217;s apparently something to do with <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0090756/"><cite class="Movies">Blue Velvet</cite></a>), but I note that it reinforces the central theme of Silencio. Rebeka del Rio lip-synching to a recording of herself&#8212;it&#8217;s indistinguishable from reality, but it&#8217;s fake. The movie is full of juxtapositions of obvious fakes and perfectly realistic fakes: Betty&#8217;s jokey rehearsal with Rita and her real rehearsal with Jimmy Katz; Adam Kesher&#8217;s unenthusiastic approval of Camilla Rhodes and his &#8220;love at first sight&#8221; moment with Betty; Naomi Watts&#8217;s bubbly Nancy Drew acting in the first part and her almost show-offy naturalistic despair in the second.</p>
<p>Backing up a bit&#8212;the two parts of the movie, the dream and the reality according to the standard interpretation. Like I said, I&#8217;ve never been convinced by the standard interpretation, but I do think there are distinct levels of reality (fictional reality, I mean) at play. The reality narrative seems more real than the dream narrative (insofar as one fiction can be more real than another), if only because it&#8217;s more sensible to extrapolate a fantastic dream from a hallucinatory reality than vice versa. But there are complications&#8212;the theme of obviously fake things and other fake things that look real in comparison, for one. For another, there&#8217;s the reversal of causality: the dream is caused by the reality, but their relationship is obfuscated by the presentation of the dream before the reality. As I watch the movie, I think, &#8220;Diane&#8217;s car ride along Mulholland Dr. is just like Rita&#8217;s&#8221;; it&#8217;s only upon consideration, after the movie, that I see clearly how causality runs backwards through the movie. It&#8217;s Diane who wakes up at the end of the dream, so it&#8217;s presumably Diane who goes to sleep at the very beginning of the movie. But when she wakes up, it&#8217;s like one of those unsettling dreams about waking up from a dream. The reality is more real than the dream, but it&#8217;s nothing like firm ground for us to stand on. But maybe that&#8217;s the best we have.</p>
<p>The dream and the reality are both stories Diane/Betty tells herself; the difference is that she&#8217;s in control of the former (for a while), while the latter crashes messily into other peoples&#8217; stories. Now we&#8217;re going way back in Peiratikos history to <a href="../../../archives/2004/01/03/prolegomena-to-a-theory-of-why-i-like-stuff/index.html">creation of self through narrative</a>. We create and know ourselves through stories, but the problem with being the authors of our own life stories is that we&#8217;re also characters in other people&#8217;s life stories.</p>
<p>I completely forgot to talk about the man behind Winkies and the blue box. Maybe later, maybe later.
