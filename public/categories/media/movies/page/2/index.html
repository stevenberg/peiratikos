<h3>What I Watched</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0053779/"><cite class="Movies">La Dolce vita</cite></a>, <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000019/"><cite class="People">Federico Fellini</cite></a> et al.:</strong> The irony of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0056801/"><cite class="Movies">8 &#189;</cite></a> is that even after Guido&#8217;s revelation that he loves everybody and can&#8217;t live without the people in his life, the movie remains trapped in his fantasy. Guido has successfully alienated everybody, but he imagines that they all forgive him and join him in a circus-like celebration of his new happiness; he imagines that everybody else&#8217;s happiness is congruous with his own. The movie remains claustrophobically solipsistic to the end. <cite>La Dolce vita</cite>, on the other hand, remains outside its protagonist Marcello&#8217;s mind. (Guido is a film director and Marcello is a gossip journalist, but they are almost variations of the same character. Guido is more playful, less seemingly defeated by decadence than Marcello; but who knows how Marcello really thinks of himself? The gauche Marcello at the end of <cite>La Dolce vita</cite> might be how the rest of the world sees Guido.) It turns out the whole doomed culture is solipsist. If Marcello ever has an inspiration like Guido&#8217;s, it remains hidden; we see only the stark reality: a sordid orgy, an encounter with a big dead fish, a moment of failed communication. <cite>La Dolce vita</cite> and <cite>8 &#189;</cite> both begin their finales with characters half-walking and half-dancing onto a beach; I recall that the characters moved left to right in <cite>8 &#189;</cite>, but in <cite>La Dolce vita</cite> they move right to left. (Rose reminds me the girl whom Marcello cannot hear and fails to recognize moves from left to right, which is certainly important.) Basic film technique: because right is good (and because Western written languages read left to right, time progresses in a left-to-right circle on a clock, &#038;c.), movement from left to right suggests progress; although the association of left and badness has largely disappeared, movement from right to left still seems backwards. In <cite>8 &#189;</cite>, of course, the characters move clockwise in a circle&#8212;the progress is as illusory as the fantasy in which it occurs.</p>
<p><cite>La Dolce vita</cite> reminds me of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0325123/"><cite class="Movies">Bright Young Things</cite></a> (which I saw first), and I imagine <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000410/"><cite class="People">Stephen Fry</cite></a> was influenced by Fellini in making his own movie. The oppressive sordidness of the upper-class and its hangers-on and the obsession with celebrity are straight out of <cite class="People">Evelyn Waugh</cite>&#8217;s book&#8212;I suppose Fellini was influenced by Waugh. But Fry&#8217;s swarms of photographers and party scenes mixing sexy young people and batty old aristocrats are straight from Fellini. There an interesting connection I just noticed between <cite class="Books">Vile Bodies</cite>/<cite>Bright Young Things</cite> and <cite>La Dolce vita</cite>, viz. the protagonists are both writers who&#8217;ve written books that are never published (Marcello&#8217;s supposed book is only mentioned, Adam&#8217;s is a finished manuscript but is confiscated as smut by Customs). Both are journalists who write celebrity gossip whose books seem to represent a failed communication of something more important and genuine&#8212;it&#8217;s easy to idealize a book that exists only hypothetically. (Adam&#8217;s book exists more than hypothetically but only to him, never to the viewer.)</p>
<h3>What I Read</h3>
<p><strong><cite class="Books">A Dictionary of Modern English Usage</cite>, <cite class="People">H.W. Fowler</cite>:</strong> An indispensable guide to using English with good taste. Provides ceaseless entertainment to the well-educated and pedantic.  The dictionary was published in 1926, so interested readers can judge the accuracy of Fowler&#8217;s speculations on future developments of usage.</p>
<p><strong><cite class="Comics">Shining Knight</cite> #3, <cite class="People">Grant Morrison</cite>, <cite class="People">Simone Bianchi</cite> et al.:</strong> Lots of exposition, <a href="http://joglikescomics.blogspot.com/2005/07/lost-post_03.html">as <cite class="People">Jog</cite> notes</a>, but it&#8217;s pretty fun. The Seven Soldiers stories all have storytelling and the unresolved dialectic of story and reality&#8212;in <cite>Shining Knight</cite> #3, a certain character&#8217;s relation of the original Arthurian myth becomes even more interesting on a second reading, after her true identity is revealed. Elsewhere, narrative captions comment on the narrative with excerpts from an Arthurian protomyth; at the end of issue #2, in fact, Sir Justin responds directly in dialogue to the narration. Morrison infuses <cite>Shining Knight</cite> with myth but avoids tiresomely literal adherence to the monomyth and overwrought quotation from <cite class="Books">The Apocalypse of John</cite>.</p>
<h3>What I Played</h3>
<p><strong><cite class="Games">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</cite>, <cite class="People">Rockstar Games</cite>:</strong> It&#8217;s by far the largest and most complex of the <cite>Grand Theft Auto</cite> games, but it introduces the new concepts gradually as part of gameplay&#8212;in fact, most of the new concepts seem to be unavailable until the game introduces them, so there&#8217;s little chance of confusion. Each new GTA game invites new controversy; I haven&#8217;t heard of any controversy yet surrounding <cite>San Andreas</cite>, but its portrayal of gang banging in the poorest neighborhoods of a fictionalized Los Angeles is unlikely to get a pass. (In fact, Rose informs me, <a href="http://nytimes.com/2005/07/11/technology/11game.html?partner=USERLAND"><cite>San Andreas</cite> is already in trouble</a>.) I was skeptical of the decision to give the player-character in <cite class="Games">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</cite> a name, personality and voice: too much emphasis on the story, which is superfluous and necessary only to give the gameplay a sensible context. <cite>San Andreas</cite>&#8217;s story has become even more, um, serious (relative only to <cite class="Games">Grand Theft Auto 3</cite>), and player-character Carl Johnson&#8217;s sad backstory (he returns to Los Santos at the beginning of the game because his mother has been murdered) is annoyingly incongruous with the hilariously frenetic gameplay. I haven&#8217;t decided yet if <cite>San Andreas</cite> is too big and too realistic, too focused on character and story, but it&#8217;s been fun for the fifteen or so hours I&#8217;ve played.

<p>Dick, Philip K. <cite class="Books">Selected Stories of Philip K. Dick</cite>. New York: Pantheon Books, 2002.</p>
<hr /><br />
<blockquote><p>[&#8230;] Anderton said: &#8220;You&#8217;ve probably grasped the basic legalistic drawback to precrime methodology. We&#8217;re taking in individuals who have broken no law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they surely will,&#8221; Witwer affirmed with conviction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Happily they <i>don&#8217;t</i>&#8212;because we get them first, before they can commit an act of violence. So the commission of the crime itself is absolute metaphysics. We claim they&#8217;re culpable. They, on the other hand, eternally claim they&#8217;re innocent. And, in a sense, they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lift let them out, and they again paced down a yellow corridor. &#8220;In our society we have no major crimes,&#8221; Anderton went on, &#8220;but we do have a detention camp full of would-be criminals. (228-229)</p></blockquote>
<p>In &#8220;Minority Report,&#8221; John Anderton is the founder and chief of Precrime. He acknowledges the apparent dilemma of precrime, but he doesn&#8217;t consider it a dilemma: it&#8217;s not a problem to imprison people who would have been considered innocent under the old &#8220;post-crime&#8221; legal system (obviously, since they haven&#8217;t actually committed a crime), because they certainly would have committed a crime if given the chance. It&#8217;s an odd metaphysics: The people who <em>will</em> commit a crime have no free will; their future is determined. But for the police who know the future, it remains undetermined; they can prevent a crime they know will be committed. It&#8217;s unclear what happens to precriminals; they may be imprisoned only until the time of their alleged crime is past or they may be imprisoned indefinitely. But either way, the system is problematic, at least from a human-rights perspective: if the police can change the future, then the future must be indeterminate; and it seems&#8212;to me, anyway&#8212;that we could <em>reasonably doubt</em> the rectitude of a conviction for a potential crime, however likely. But Anderton has absolute faith in the system, until the prediction of his own commission of murder comes in:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You have to be taken in&#8212;if Precrime is to survive. You&#8217;re thinking of your own safety. But think, for a moment, about the system. [&#8230;] Which means more to you&#8212;your own personal safety or the existence of the system?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My safety,&#8221; Anderton answered, without hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re positive?&#8221;</p>
<p>[&#8230;] &#8220;If the system can survive only by imprisoning innocent people, then it deserves to be destroyed. My personal safety is important because I&#8217;m a human being.&#8221; (250)</p></blockquote>
<p>He has apparently be framed&#8212;by his new assistant Witwer, he first thinks, but it turns about to be the Army&#8212;for the future murder of retire general Leopold Kaplan, except it turns out he wasn&#8217;t framed: the prediction is accurate. But he nows he won&#8217;t kill Kaplan&#8212;he was going to kill Kaplan the Army manipulated events so that he would, and after he discovers this plot he suddenly has no reason to commit murder. As it turns out, though, that was the Army&#8217;s plan all along: get a murder prediction for Anderton, let him discover their plot to prevent him from actually committing the murder, then discredit Precrime by revealing the clearly inaccurate prediction. Their goal is to get Precrime shut down so they can step in and take control of the police state.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the precog mutants (there are three) is slightly out of phase with the other two, like a clock running slow; and he, with Anderton&#8217;s knowledge of his own future as part of his predictive data set, predicts that Anderton will <em>not</em> commit murder. This minority report, as it&#8217;s called, doesn&#8217;t help Precrime much, as the Army plans to present it as proof that Anderton wouldn&#8217;t have committed murder. When a minority report occurs, it&#8217;s assumed that the majority report is accurate, so the Army can point out that in Anderton&#8217;s case, the minority report is in fact the accurate prediction.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more important: his own life, or the system he created? Will he sacrifice the system he created to save himself? He sure will&#8212;until he discovers the Army&#8217;s goal of usurping Precrime&#8217;s position, at which point he quickly and silently changes his mind. After reviewing the three precog reports, he discovers that there are in fact <em>three</em> out-of-phase minority reports: the first predicts he will murder Kaplan, the second predicts he will change his mind and not murder Kaplan, the third predicts he will change his mind again and murder Kaplan after all. The third prediction provides him an opportunity to foil the Army&#8217;s plan: he must murder Kaplan to demonstrate the system&#8217;s accuracy. Will he sacrifice himself to save the system he created? He will. But only a few minutes before he finally decides to kill Kaplan, he was convinced of the system&#8217;s inhumanity and injustice. How does he justify his change of heart? He cheats. When Witwer worries about the serious flaw in the system implied by Anderton&#8217;s surprising sequence of predictions, Anderton says, &#8220;It can only happen in one circumstance [&#8230;] My case was unique, since I had access to the data&#8221; (264). It&#8217;s a weak argument. It&#8217;s true that the precogs turned out to be correct in Anderton&#8217;s case; but as he says, his case is unique: that the precogs would happen to make three <em>different</em> predictions such that the predictions demonstrate that the future is determinate rather than indeterminate is wildly implausible, and Anderton is unbelievably lucky it happened to him. Much more likely, in a case like Anderton&#8217;s, the precogs would end up with an inaccurate prediction. Anderton insists that you can change your future only if you know what it&#8217;s supposed to be, but that&#8217;s metaphysical theorizing, and there&#8217;s no apparent reason to believe it. The predictions of Anderton&#8217;s commission of murder are accurate (in a bizarre way), but their more important implication is that the future is indeterminate, that a prediction doesn&#8217;t indicate something that will certainly happen unless the police prevent it. That much was obvious to us readers from the beginning, of course, and Anderton&#8217;s ordeal makes the problem painfully clear. But, for Anderton, political necessity trumps personal safety <em>and</em> human rights.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually not completely sure what I want to say about <cite>Minority Report</cite> yet, so I&#8217;ll end here for now.

<div class="text">
<p>Film adaptations of <cite class="People">Philip K. Dick</cite>&#8217;s stories are obviously nothing like the stories. But I&#8217;ve never thought in depth about specifically how they differ, so now I&#8217;m looking at Dick&#8217;s &#8220;Minority Report&#8221; vs. <cite class="People">Steven Spielberg</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Movies">Minority Report</cite>.</p>
<p>First, most immediately obvious, is style. Here&#8217;s a passage from &#8220;Minority Report&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Jerry&#8221; was twenty-four years old. Originally, he had been classified as a hydrocephalic idiot but when he reached the age of six the psych testers had identified the precog talent, buried under the layers of tissue corrosion. Placed in a government-operated training school, the latent talent had been cultivated. By the time he was nine the talent had advanced to a useful stage. &#8220;Jerry,&#8221; however, remained in the aimless chaos of idiocy; the burgeoning faculty had absorbed the totality of his personality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Serviceable but unpolished. It&#8217;s a little clunky; the third sentence is carelessly ungrammatical. Having read several of Dick&#8217;s novels and short stories, I suspect he would write a story once, as quickly as he could, and never look back. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s really the case; but he wrote forty-four novels and one-hundred twenty-one short stories in about thirty years, so he couldn&#8217;t have had much time for revision and proofreading. Dick&#8217;s writing isn&#8217;t always as rough as that passage, and it has its own shabby charm; but mostly, you don&#8217;t Dick to admire his lovely prose style. He rushes too urgently through the story to have style.</p>
<p>The story also lacks for description, both of the future world and the immediate environments and characters. Anything that must be described receives minimal description. The story takes place in New York, under the control of the Federal Westbloc Government; &#8220;Federal&#8221; suggests some continuity with the United States of America, and &#8220;Westbloc&#8221; suggests the government is a descendent of NATO. There was a devestating Anglo-Chinese War which left much of at least North America in blasted ruins, during which the Westbloc was controlled entirely by the military, which operated a domestic police force in addition to fighting the war. After the war, the Westbloc was demilitarized and the Precrime Agency founded to run the police force. There is a Senate, but it&#8217;s not clear what it does or what the government looks like at all. The preceeding paragraph is not a summary: it is almost the entirety of the setting information provided by the story itself. There are a few other details, but none of them implies a deeper world than is explicitly presented.</p>
<p>But consider <cite>Minority Report</cite>. Like all film adaptations of Dick&#8217;s work, the first thing you notice is how <em>good</em> it looks. Not only good, but polished and shiny; the entire movie has a hazy, slightly overexposed glow. It looks like the inside of a tv ad. True, it&#8217;s not all shiny and tv-ready: Spielberg&#8217;s vision of Dick&#8217;s paranoid future does have slums populated by illicit Russian surgeons and drug dealers who&#8217;ve removed their own eyes to avoid ubiquitous retinal scanners. But the prettiness seeps even into the slum, in the form of a huge tv screen running ads for the precog police unit attached to the bottom of an overpass. (I&#8217;m not sure whether the slum advertising is supposed to be frightening or comforting, but it doesn&#8217;t matter in the end; the slum is forgotten in the climactic confrontation between the powerful.)</p>
<p>Where Dick&#8217;s story lacks style, Spielberg&#8217;s movie is intensely stylized; and where Dick&#8217;s world is sparse, Spielberg&#8217;s is dense. That density is necessary for Spielberg&#8217;s Hollywood brand of realism. It&#8217;s part of Spielberg&#8217;s schtick: he goes to great lengths to present a plausible future reality. (Of course, plausibility always comes second to thrilling chase scenes.) According to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&#038;node=&#038;contentId=A20469-2002Jun20"><cite class="People">Joel Garreau</cite>&#8217;s account</a> of Spielberg&#8217;s <cite>Minority Report</cite> futurist think tank, producer <cite class="People">Bonnie Curtis</cite> claimed that the movie is grounded in &#8220;future reality&#8221; rather than &#8220;science fiction.&#8221; I know Spielberg said something similar about <cite class="Movies">Jurassic Park</cite> back in 1993&#8212;I believe he used the phrase &#8220;science future&#8221;&#8212;but unfortunately I don&#8217;t have a citation for that. In his piece, Garreau says that</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;the moviemakers seem to have gone to great deal of trouble to make this a legally persuasive future. The tension throughout the movie is between safety and freedom, a timely topic in 2002. And the whole plot of the movie centers on the notion that this Pre-Cog system is utterly infallible. Only thus can it be seen as reasonable search and seizure. Philip K. Dick didn&#8217;t go to this much trouble in his 1956 story of the same name on which the film is based.</p></blockquote>
<p>These statements not only demonstrate a profound ignorance of science fiction outside the sealed-off reality of Hollywood; they also suggest how and why the filmmakers fail to understand or choose to ignore Dick&#8217;s point. For Dick, the point is not specifically how the Constitution would have to change to allow the existence of a precrime police agency in the United States; the point is to discover the more fundamental change required in society, the moral implications of that change and the impossibility of unchanging it. Details of world-building are unimportant, so Dick leaves them out. For Spielberg, though, the spectacle of an amazing future (and amazing chase scenes!) is at least as important as the moral implications of that future, if not moreso. Spielberg love big shiny toys&#8212;in fact, most filmmakers in Hollywood making science-fiction movies love big shiny toys.  Despite Bonnie Curtis&#8217;s misguided praise, <cite>Minority Report</cite> is not fundamentally much different from, say, <cite>The Matrix</cite>: both movies surround a potentially daring speculative concept with dazzling Hollwood spectacle. (Actually, <cite>The Matrix</cite> is an unusually clever example of Hollywood science fiction: it turns its dazzling spectacle into something weightier by presenting a speculation about the relationship between reality and spectacle.) Spielberg likes to hire experts for a sense of authoritative realism, but that&#8217;s only another part of the spectacle.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for Part 2: John Anderton vs. John Anderton.

The bulk of Sean&#8217;s reply to Rosenbaum focuses on Rosenbaum&#8217;s perceived anti-white-male prejudice, and <a href="http://foragerblog.blogspot.com/2005/05/anti-white-bias-of-kill-bills-critics.html"><cite class="People">Jon Hastings</cite> has already pointed out the flaws</a> in Sean&#8217;s invocation of race. And <a href="http://www.alltooflat.com/about/personal/sean/?BlogNum=945">Sean has acknowledged the flaws</a> and further claimed that his argument is really mostly against Rosenbaum&#8217;s &#8220;anti-male, anti-fanboy&#8221; prejudice. Which, first of all, being anti-fanboy isn&#8217;t the same thing at all as being anti-male, so let&#8217;s not obfuscate things. And as for being anti-fanboy&#8212;Rosenbaum is that, indeed. Is Rosenbaum talking crazy talk?</p>
<p>Now, most of you reading this blog probably have had some exposure to geek subculture; I&#8217;m sure you know what a fanboy is. And you know that there are&#8212;um, <em>girl</em> fanboys too, which is a problem for the gender-specificity of the term. Or is it? In the egalitarian twenty-first century, we can <em>all</em> be nerdy ????ber-fans, but who dominates? From where I&#8217;m looking, it&#8217;s guys, guys, guys. Sean specifically cites <cite class="People">Elizabeth Avellan</cite> as a producer of <cite class="Movies">Sin City</cite>&#8212;one of eight, and producers don&#8217;t really have creative input in modern filmmaking anyway. He also cites <cite class="People">Uma Thurman</cite>&#8217;s collaboration with <cite class="People">Quentin Tarantino</cite> on <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill</cite>, which I don&#8217;t know much about. But that some women have creative roles in these movies doesn&#8217;t have a lot of weight against Rosenbaum&#8217;s argument, especially because, N.B., how many women <em>direct</em> these fanboy movies? (By the way, Jon makes the good point that <cite>Sin City</cite> is not referential in the same way <cite>Kill Bill</cite> is, but I think that&#8217;s only a minor flaw in Rosenbaum&#8217;s argument. Rosenbaum also mentions <cite class="Movies">Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow</cite>, and I&#8217;m inclined to think these movies use different means to reach similar ends.) I don&#8217;t know of any. Are there any? But even if there are, let&#8217;s face it, the dominant creative source, and the dominant audience destination, of fanboy movies is guys. They&#8217;re called fanboys for a reason, after all&#8212;it&#8217;s silly to claim women <em>aren&#8217;t</em> involved in this stuff (not that Rosenbaum actually claimed any such thing, that I see), but it&#8217;s equally silly to claim that the stereotypical association of fanboy stuff&#8212;manly violence, phallic symbols (swords!), pseudo-feminist &#8220;tough-guy women&#8221; characters, &#038;c.&#8212;with <em>guys</em> is <em>entirely false</em>.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen <cite>Sin City</cite> and I&#8217;m not sure I will, so I don&#8217;t really know about that. But <cite>Kill Bill</cite> is, in its every aspect, fanboyism turned into an aesthetic. Deep morality? Oh ho. Maybe more on this later, or maybe you all have figured out what I think of <cite>Kill Bill</cite> by now, since I&#8217;ve written about it so much. For now, I might as well link back to <a href="../../../../../archives/2005/01/10/remix/index.html">&#8220;Remix Aesthetic in <cite class="Movies">Moulin Rouge</cite> and <cite>Kill Bill</cite>.&#8221; </a> Also, consider: a movie which portentously bleeps out the main character&#8217;s name, solely to set up two of the dumbest name-based puns in history, is the very definition of <em>deliberately</em> pretentiously stupid.

<div class="text">
<p><cite class="People">Steven</cite> is gearing up for exams, so I got to spend the entire evening alone, which is the first time I&#8217;ve had 4 hours to myself in years I think.  I squandered it on a gin hot toddy and microwaved Indian food and then watched <cite class="Movies">Casa de los Babys</cite>, and now I&#8217;m happy. Well, happy and exhausted and headachy, but you can&#8217;t have everything. What you can have is a short post from me, it seems.</p>
<p>See, <cite>Casa</cite> has got me thinking about stories and scale and what people prefer. I guess this was on my mind this weekend in <a href="../../../../../archives/2005/04/24/pittcon/index.html">Pittsburgh</a>, which I think was my first major group comics shopping expedition. Part of what I&#8217;ve really enjoyed in being a comics blogger is seeing what people like and especially why. What I&#8217;m realizing more and more, though, is that I like the little things best. I don&#8217;t care if worlds will change and paradigms will crumble; I just want to see some interesting characters do or think or say or be interesting things.  </p>
<p>And while I&#8217;ve always assumed that at bare minimum gender keeps me out of the target demographic for Marvel and DC, I&#8217;m also just not going to be interested in whatever exploding-continuity mega-crossover story they offer not because I don&#8217;t care about superheroes but because I don&#8217;t care about the scale. I have no interest in the Marvel universe, but I think useful stories can be told within it. I know I&#8217;m talking about the same things over and over again, that I care about property damage and innocent bystanders in superhero and action movie carnage, that I&#8217;d like <cite class="Comics">Vimanarama</cite> much more if it were just a love story without all the cosmic strife, that I often prefer the throwaway characters to the egotistical protagonists. I know this is all about me and it&#8217;s nothing especially new.</p>
<p>In <cite>Casa de los Babys</cite>, six women have come from the United States to a Latin American country, where they wait together for the babies they hope to adopt. Meanwhile there&#8217;s a fully realized world of maids and child beggars and students and bitter revolutionaries and hopeful idealists. And people live their lives and have the moments of communication and revelation and missed opportunity that happen in life, and then the movie is over. And to me that&#8217;s much more successful than if it had all been wrapped up nicely with a montage of smiling pastel babies and a soundtrack surge that reminds me I should be weepier. It helps, of course, that there was superb acting on both Mexican and foreign fronts, good writing that was specific  and sturdy without being overwrought, a world without angels (or villains).</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m starting to wonder if I&#8217;m in the minority here, too. I keep saying I&#8217;ll write about <cite class="Comics">Project Superior</cite>, which I do hope to do, but not when I&#8217;ll be into overtime hours by lunch tomorrow with a full day&#8217;s work and more on Saturday ahead of me. And the thing about <cite>Project Superior</cite> stories is that many of them were pretty straightforward and clear, making a point and then getting on with things, even the ones that presented themselves as slice-of-life. But there&#8217;s a big difference between unpretentious revelation and portentousness, and I think that&#8217;s what <cite class="People">Alan David Doane</cite> misses in his <a href="http://www.comicbookgalaxy.com/042205_review_2.html">praise for only the most trite (if still a bit touching) story in <cite class="Comics">Flight 2</cite></a>.  Not all comics have to be symbol-heavy because honestly not all comics creators have the brains and intuition to pull it off.  And as an aside, I&#8217;m so tired of people saying that <cite class="People">Grant Morrison</cite> is all ideas and no execution, because I think the opposite is far more true. (And no, I don&#8217;t think it matters what I think, either.) </p>
<p>It&#8217;s someone who understands taking little, mundane things and making them hold, making them strong enough to withstand some insight and inquiry that makes the kind of art I prefer and enjoy. I don&#8217;t care about the epic plots of triumph and tribulation anywhere near as much because I don&#8217;t think life requires (or allows) solving some magical jigsaw puzzle. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a narrative that makes it all make sense, but it&#8217;s only because there are so many narratives that we can make sense of anything at all. And I don&#8217;t expect anyone to cater to my preferences, but I still enjoy finding things I like when and where I can. It&#8217;s like having a quiet night alone to relax and think and be happy, and I wouldn&#8217;t mind if my life had more of both.

<p>In honor of one year of <cite class="People">Milo George</cite> and his quest to end Endemic Treponematosis, <a href="http://milogeorge.blogspot.com/2005/03/big-movie-meme-vs-endemic.html">we&#8217;re stuck with a movie meme</a>. </p>
<p>But we couldn&#8217;t quite follow the rules, especially since we have a policy of not passing on these stupid things. However, if you want to swipe a copy, this one wouldn&#8217;t be your worst choice. We realphabetized the list to get things where they belong to begin with and to treat numbers differently and ignore leading articles in all titles, English or not. Foreign movies are listed by what we deem as the most readily recognizable title here in the U.S. All movies have years associated, now including ones directed by <cite class="People">Kevin Smith</cite> (which Steven wouldn&#8217;t let me remove). The Three Colors trilogy only shows up once instead of twice, although it&#8217;s a little crazy that the Matrix trilogy gets three entries when Kieslowski and <cite class="People">Satyajit Ray</cite> get three-in-one treatment. </p>
<p>And speaking of three colors, movies seen by <span style="color:red">Steven</span> and not me are displayed in <span style="color:red">red</span>. Movies only <span style="color:blue"><cite class="People">Rose</cite></span> has seen are <span style="color:blue">blue</span>. Movies we have <span style="color:purple">both</span> seen, together or separately, show up in <span class="color:purple">purple</span>, which I realize is sickeningly symbolic and romantic and whatnot. Movies <b>we own</b> are in <b>bold</b>. Because of this, we apologize to any visually impaired readers, but you&#8217;re really not missing anything if you have to skip this post anyway. </p>

<div class="text">
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to write a post about <cite class="Movies">Shaun of the Dead</cite>, but it&#8217;s been tough going. I know vaguely what I want to say, but I seem to have no interest in turning my vague thoughts into words. Oh well. Instead, I&#8217;ve been thinking about postmodern horror of an entirely different kind.</p>
<p>But should I first discuss what kind of postmodern horror <cite>Shaun of the Dead</cite> is, since I&#8217;ve already contrasted it with the kind of postmodern horror I actually want to write about? Yes, I suppose I should. <cite>Shaun of the Dead</cite>, of course, is in the tradition of self-conscious/ironic horror movies, movies like <cite class="Movies">Scream</cite> and even <cite class="Movies">Scary Movie</cite>. The authors (I will use &#8220;authors&#8221; to refer collectively to the people who made a movie) of <cite>Scream</cite> take on the relatively easy and ultimately banal task of making a straight slasher flick, with one crucial violation of the rules: the characters know about slasher flicks, spend much of their time discussing slasher flicks, and recognize immediately that they are living inside a slasher flick. The result is a movie that balances precariously on the line between jokiness and sincerity and isn&#8217;t quite deft enough to avoid stumbling. It&#8217;s reasonably entertaining, although the authors&#8217; mocking indulgence in the slasher genre&#8217;s violent and exploitative virgin/whore morality makes for some particularly queasy scenes. The second and third movies might have improved on the formula&#8212;I don&#8217;t remember clearly.</p>
<p>Before I saw <cite>Shaun of the Dead</cite>, I expected a goofier, indier <cite>Scream</cite>. But whereas <cite>Scream</cite> approaches the problem of self-conscious postmodern narrative by presenting characters who discuss horror-movie cliches at the same time that they act out those cliches, the trailer for <cite>Shaun of the Dead</cite> suggests that it takes the different approach of riffing facetiously on little details and problems that tend to get glossed over in other movies&#8212;viz. the talk-show guest who insists on staying married to her zombified husband. Sort of a converse <cite>Scream</cite>, a self-conscious joke-horror movie that shakes up the familiar narrative by making the characters <em>less</em> clever instead of <em>more</em>&#8212;not only do they not notice the zombie-movie plot mechanics clunking along around them, they mess with the mechanics by failing to fall properly into their roles.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I thought <em>before</em> I saw the movie. Mostly, anyway&#8212;I&#8217;m partly reconstructing my thoughts in light of having seen it. What do I think now that I&#8217;ve finally seen it? Well, it&#8217;s sort of like I expected it to be, but it also has other more interesting things going on. It starts with a strong romantic-comedy foundation. Shaun is a 29-year-old guy who suspects he ought to take things more seriously but seems to have trouble finding things that right taking seriously. His sidekick is Ed, who &#8220;doesn&#8217;t have too many friends,&#8221; which is an understatement. Shaun&#8217;s girlfriend is Liz, who has tired of Shaun&#8217;s inertial inability to discover nightly entertainment opportunities outside the local pub. <em>Her</em> sidekicks are David and Dianne, a pretentious twat and a flightly failed actress, respectively. Liz is one botched date from dumping Shaun for good. David is in love with Liz and doing a pathetic job of hiding it from his girlfriend Dianne. Dianne wants to know when Shaun&#8217;s going to hook them up with free cable. Ed&#8217;s single endearing quality is his ability to perform a remarkably poor impression of an orangutan. Shaun&#8212;well, he doesn&#8217;t exactly <em>want</em> to spend the rest of his life drinking himself to death at the Winchester (the aforementioned local pub), but all the better alternatives have the flaw of requiring him to do something other than sit around the local pub.</p>
<p>Hmm, it&#8217;s been several days since I looked at this post. I seem to have been writing some kind of plot summary of <cite>Shaun of the Dead</cite>. But what&#8217;s the point&#8212;I don&#8217;t have the movie anymore, so I can hardly do a close reading. It&#8217;s been weeks since I saw the movie! I will now speak vaguely and noncomittally.</p>
<p>So <cite>Shaun of the Dead</cite> starts as a romantic comedy, and it could easily have kept going without zombies for a whole movie. Throwing in zombies is dangerous, because it means people like me might say, &#8220;If they wanted to do a romantic comedy about the unresolvable opposition of needing to grow up and not wanting to become one&#8217;s parents, why are they wasting their (and, more importantly, my) time with <em>zombies</em>?&#8221; But I didn&#8217;t say this while watching this movie. Partly because the authors take the time to play connect-the-themes. The shots of a stumbly, zombie-sounding Shaun who turns out to be merely a sleepy, yawning Shaun, the zombified wage-slave drones who are literally zombified and then put to work as&#8212;zombie slaves, I guess&#8212;funny jokes, but also plugged right into Shaun&#8217;s real-life concerns. (And, yes, terribly obvious and presumably done in every other zombie movie ever. Well, it&#8217;s a zombie movie, you work with what you&#8217;ve got. <cite>Shaun of the Dead</cite> works with what it&#8217;s got stylishly and intelligently. [???????But if they wanted to do a movie about the unresolvable opposition &#038;c., why <em>did</em> they waste their time with zombies?&#8221; I&#8217;m not going to get into a defense of using the fantastic in art here, sorry. Um, because sometimes mere naturalism isn&#8217;t enough for some others, and then they break out the zombies.]) Let&#8217;s continue that line of thought, but outside the parentheses. What the zombie stuff does is latch onto specifc real-life concerns in the narrative, complicate and modify them, cause them to resonate with greater intensity.</p>
<p>Damn, I&#8217;ve been sloppy in talking about the romantic-comed aspect of <cite>Shaun of the Dead</cite>. Because, when you think about it, romantic comedy as a genre functions like a lot of fantasy&#8212;i.e., it latches onto specific real-life concerns, complicates and modifies them, causes them to resonate with greater intensity. So <cite>Shaun of the Dead</cite> has the romantic comedy <em>and</em> the zombies messing with the narrative. But is that enough for Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg? Certainly not. They add that extra layer of self-consciousness, which allows them to slip back and forth between zombies and romantic comedy without getting bogged down in either. There are three big things going on in the movie&#8212;the romantic comedy, the zombie stuff, and the mucky &#8220;human drama&#8221;&#8212;and each is so emotionally intense (and gorily harrowing, in the case of the zombie stuff) that it could easily overwhelm the whole movie. But the extra layer of irony allows the movie to flip deftly with precision timing from the chilling revelation of Shaun&#8217;s mum&#8217;s impending zombification to jokes about David wanting to shoot Shaun&#8217;s mum to simple &#8220;human drama&#8221; as the relationships between characters build tension and explode in heady conflict. The section of the movie from the musical zombie fighting/dancing choreographed to <cite class="People">Queen</cite>&#8217;s &#8220;Don&#8217;t Stop Me Now&#8221; to the moment when Shaun, Liz and Ed find themselves trapped behind the bar is the final buildup and climax of the movie. These scenes have <em>everything</em> going on at once, and it really shouldn&#8217;t work but it does anyway, and it&#8217;s lovely.</p>
<p>Er, I guess I ended up writing a lot about <cite>Shaun of the Dead</cite> after all. And not about the kind of postmodern horror film I claimed I&#8217;d write about at the beginning of this post. I suppose I could edit the beginning of the post to make things make more sense, but I think I&#8217;ll leave it as is. More to come on postmodern horror&#8230; some time. I won&#8217;t promise timeliness.

<p>So I haven&#8217;t been here in a while, it seems. I&#8217;ve been sick a lot this winter, but also just completely worn down. I don&#8217;t know when either of those will relent for good, but I&#8217;ll aim for weekly posting and see if I can work up from there. If I have anything to say (and I do have a big post on identification festering, but it&#8217;s not written yet) I&#8217;ll try to get it up here somehow. For tonight, though, just a few quick truths with little analysis.</p>
<p><cite class="Comics">Vimanarama</cite> #2 made me cry a little, but only a little. Dig the Taj Mahal interior, though! I&#8217;m not sold on the coloring and I read a lot faster when the Fireborn are doing their thing. I wish this were going to be more than three issues long.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s up with the (<a href="http://johnnybacardi.blogspot.com/2005/03/well-hello-dere_01.html">potential</a>) <a href="http://comicsatemybrain.blogspot.com/2005/01/up-up-and-away.html">total depletion</a> of other Kentucky comics bloggers? To make up for the gaps in my pseudopeer group, I&#8217;m pushing for a clique of <a href="http://precur.blogspot.com/2005/03/little-something-for-ladies.html">comics bloggers who read manga in the bathtub</a>. It looks like there may be some overlap with the comics bloggers who enjoy gin (a more casual grouping that exists only in my head, as far as I know) which suggests some clear options for socializing that I&#8217;ll bet we&#8217;ll never try.</p>
<p><cite class="People">Steven</cite> is on spring break and thus did a Wednesday comic run, which still seems sort of weird and obscene to me, but I hoped it would net us <cite class="Comics">Project Superior</cite>, which the store had not ordered. They should have one for us next week, and I do realize that if we weren&#8217;t so passive and uncomfortable talking to people we would have had one now. So there was none of that and no manga for my bath, so I resorted to feminist essay collections. From <cite class="Books">Feminism Beside Itself</cite>, I liked <cite class="People">Elspeth Probyn</cite>&#8217;s piece, &#8220;Perverts by Choice.&#8221; She writes of belonging/be-longing as &#8220;a loose <i lang="fr">combinatoire</i> of being and longing, becoming and nostalgia, as composed of lines of desire that run along the singularities of sexualities, bodies, spaces and places.&#8221; (264) I quote this not to scare anyone off from drinking gin or enjoying bathtime manga, but because it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m going to be thinking about off-blog and possibly but probably not on-.</p>
<p>I know <a href="http://spatulaforum.blogspot.com/2005/03/ok-heres-existential-video-review-for.html">not everyone liked <cite class="Movies">I &hearts; Huckabees</cite></a>, but I think the mud sex scene was one of the most emotionally realistic portrayals I&#8217;ve ever seen in a movie. Anyone who disagrees is wrong, but that&#8217;s ok; I know beauty when I see it. I got the double-disc set as a birthday present (<a href="http://tinctoris.com/">thanks!</a>) and am looking forward to rewatching the film itself this weekend. I got very close to finishing a major in philosophy before dropping it, in large part because I hated so many of the other students, so I&#8217;m not sure if that means I&#8217;m more sensitive or less sensitive to dopey philosophy stuff, but nothing in <cite>Huckabees</cite> bothered me.</p>
<p>And continuing my trend of no real segues, I&#8217;m probably going to be teaching a class on sock knitting, so I&#8217;ve been doing a bit of it myself. I have a really hideous pair I made to test some techniques and a cotton/wool yarn (I&#8217;ll have to teach on larger than sock yarn, though, because apparently size 0 needles terrify new knitters) and I should probably put a picture of them up here so that the ugliness will be a good incentive to post something substantive to get it off the top of the page. The plus side is that they fit me perfectly and keep my feet warm when it is too, too cold in the apartment, which has definitely been the case over the last few nights.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t yet done any <a href="../../../../../archives/2005/01/14/proposal/index.html">blogger interviews</a> because I haven&#8217;t really done much of anything except work ridiculously long hours and try to sleep (well, and knit socks). I think I&#8217;m getting close to having my research done for the first, though. I&#8217;m hoping I live in enough of a shame culture that my commenting on this will push me to do it, but past performance has not been a positive indicator, to use work-speak. Maybe soon.

<p>This post has been stagnating for over a week now. Other posts that wait unfinished for so long I just kill because I can&#8217;t pick up my thoughts well enough to keep going, but I&#8217;m hoping I can weave this together topically. See, I haven&#8217;t written here because I&#8217;ve been sick and I don&#8217;t know why. I had a flu a week (two weeks?) ago and have just been exhausted ever since. No fever, though I have more nightmares than usual, but I spent this weekend taking 3-hour naps and then wanting another one a few hours later. I&#8217;m just miserable and completely drained, which I&#8217;m sure has been a lot of fun for all the people who have to spend time with me, too.</p>
<p>At any rate, I stayed up a week ago Sunday reading <cite class="Comics">It&#8217;s a Bird&#8230;</cite>, <cite class="People">Steven Seagle</cite>&#8217;s fictionalized account of his personal crisis when offered a job writing Superman. It&#8217;s a physically beautiful volume, a comfortable size with fascinating art, but it was the story I&#8217;d wanted to read for a long time. In the story at least, Seagle&#8217;s family has a history of Huntington&#8217;s disease, and so his first tie to Superman is an issue of the comic he and his brother share in a hospital waiting room while the adults confer about his grandmother&#8217;s condition. Huntington&#8217;s is a family secret he hasn&#8217;t discussed with anyone growing up, something he was aware of without understanding at all, and the Superman gig and the news that his father has disappeared bring it to the surface.</p>
<p>Apparently Seagle (again, at least in the story; from here on out I&#8217;ll just treat &#8220;Seagle&#8221; as the fictional character since we have a <cite class="People">Steven</cite> on the site already, and I&#8217;ll deal with Seagle-the-author-guy as needed when he shows up) didn&#8217;t learn about Huntington&#8217;s when he took biology, which is strange because I know we covered it as early as 7th grade. I was 12 and I was obsessed, because it seemed like such perfect story material. While Seagle says it lacks a celebrity face, there&#8217;s <cite class="People">Woody Guthrie</cite>, whose frailty in his son&#8217;s movie <cite class="Movies">Alice&#8217;s Restaurant</cite>  apparently made quite an impression on viewers at the time, if my mother is to be believed. I mention this also because the parent/child relationship is at the core of the tragedy of Huntington&#8217;s, so while Woody&#8217;s decline is in some ways that of his generation (and Arlo&#8217;s drifting and trying to avoid the war is supposed to be characteristic of his decadent, passionate generation) it is also part of a story about what it means to be watching your father die young and painfully while your classmates are doing the same thing half a world away. Huntington&#8217;s, as I recall from my long-ago studies, is a real <cite class="People">O. Henry</cite> disease; by the time you realize you have it at age 40 or so, you&#8217;ve already passed it on to your children. It&#8217;s practically the only (certainly the only I know) major genetic disease that is dominant rather than recessive, which means that there are no carriers. Either you have it or you don&#8217;t. If one of your parents has it, there&#8217;s a 50 percent chance you will, too. </p>
<p>Seagle didn&#8217;t really play with that aspect of it, didn&#8217;t talk about the odds, which seemed, well, odd in a story in which he worries so much about his own chances. He doesn&#8217;t tell his girlfriend that there are genetic screenings available now (another messy, tough issue that would make good story fodder) perhaps because he doesn&#8217;t know, but also because this is the story of his myopically private anguish. And  really that&#8217;s what made it interesting. The book is comprised of vignettes, glimpses of Seagle with his girlfriend or with his editor or looking for his father or writing about Superman or the comics versions of the Superman stories he was writing. Seagle&#8217;s initial argument in wanting to turn down the Superman gig is that he has nothing to say about this invincible man, but he realizes that Superman works best as a foil for our flaws, as a way to safely understand the limits of our doomed bodies. <cite>It&#8217;s a Bird&#8230;</cite>, in addressing this head-on, is probably a more successful Superman story than most I&#8217;ve read, which isn&#8217;t saying much. It creates a sort of universal appeal because we all (I hope) worry occasionally or often about the secrets our genes and our families hold and what will happen when they get out.</p>
<p>Maybe I was just a receptive audience because I have to do a daily checkup on my mystery ailment to figure out whether things are getting worse (nope) or better (possibly today, I hope). Other people have to worry about cholesterol or tendencies toward cancers. And then there&#8217;s the history we know we hold, the times lately I&#8217;ve had to assess my ennui: is this normal stress and sadness or a return of the sort of depression from which there seems to be no escape? One part of what makes reading fun is that it&#8217;s a way to get out of my body a bit (when the books aren&#8217;t too heavy or my arms too tired) without pretending I don&#8217;t have one or that it has nothing to do with what&#8217;s going on in my head. </p>
<p>What was going on in my head as I read <cite>It&#8217;s a Bird&#8230;</cite> was initially disappointment that Seagle (author and character) didn&#8217;t seem to have more than superficial insights into Superman, that there were potentially some factual errors I don&#8217;t even remember anymore (I&#8217;m not sure about a connection between the Nazi-mandated Star of David and Superman&#8217;s outfit) but also hope that something more would come of this. It&#8217;s not as deep as what I would have wanted, but nothing much seems to be lately (and is this a symptom of laziness and overwork and intellectual stagnation on my part? I think so!) and I&#8217;m not the one who got to write it or even wanted to. It&#8217;s a beautiful book and a thoughtful one, a story about superheroes that strives for harmony, peace, a calmed self. For all that I enjoyed it and would have liked it even more if I&#8217;d waited until this week to buy it in paperback, but that&#8217;s not really an option. We do what we choose with the time that we&#8217;ve got, and if that means I occasionally buy a hardcover book at full price, so be it.  And now I&#8217;ll wind some yarn and rest.

<p class="postmeta"><a href="../../../../../archives/2005/01/index.html" title="January 2005 Archive">28 January 2005</a> by <a href="mailto:&#114;&#111;s&#101;&#46;&#99;ur&#116;in&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;il.com" title="Send an e-mail to Rose">Rose</a> &#8212; Filed under <a href="../../../comics/index.html" title="View all posts in Comics" rel="category tag">Comics</a>,  <a href="../../index.html" title="View all posts in Movies" rel="category tag">Movies</a></p>
<div class="text">
<p>I got to read <a href="http://www.eye.net/eye/issue/issue_01.27.05/city/panelist.html">the article in <cite class="News">The Eye</cite></a> that <a href="../../../../../archives/2005/01/14/proposal/index.html#comments"><cite class="People">Bryan Lee O&#8217;Malley</cite> alluded to earlier</a> when it went live today. I have a long-running skepticism toward interviews where illustrative quotes are pulled out of the ether, so I&#8217;m curious about where this mention of a movie really came from. Did <cite class="People">Guy Leshinski</cite> say, &#8220;So, is this something you&#8217;d like to see play as a movie?&#8221; to get O&#8217;Malley to admit that &#8220;[t]he holy grail for cartoonists is the movie deal&#8221; or what? </p>
<p>I ask even though I have no right to ask, because it caused a crisis of conscience. I enjoyed <cite class="Comics">Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s Precious Little Life</cite> so much that I&#8217;m not even going to link to all the places where I talked about it because I know all my readers know this already. And because I talked about it so much, because I was an &#8220;early adopter,&#8221; Bryan Lee O&#8217;Malley contacted me and we ended up doing an interview in which I didn&#8217;t ask about movie options. That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m becoming some sort of hipster geek. My immediate response to the section of this profile asking about movie options was, &#8220;NO!!! Hollywood could never handle this right!!&#8221; That&#8217;s kind of goofy, since a <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite> movie wouldn&#8217;t even have to be a Hollywood movie, but I&#8217;m just being honest here. While I think the book deserves success and a wider audience (and the money/security audience brings its creator) something makes me want to think that this book is pure, that it&#8217;s not just another attempt at a movie deal. And those aren&#8217;t mutually exclusive; it could be a perfectly good comic (and certainly is) and also make a fine movie, but I&#8217;m so taken by the way it works as sequential art that I wouldn&#8217;t want to read a <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite> novel (and I&#8217;m lying a bit; I&#8217;d read it for sure) or hear what hot young actresses <a href="http://www.wizarduniverse.com/"><cite class="News">Wizard</cite></a> thinks would be even hotter as Kim or Ramona or Knives (and here I tell the truth). I want to just let things be themselves. But the flipside hipstery side of this is that I have to be sure I&#8217;m not saying this because I don&#8217;t want to be a person being neurotic that my favorite indie band is about to make it big and then I won&#8217;t be special anymore.  I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on, but I just as strongly hope that there isn&#8217;t going to be a movie made and I can keep these comics comics. After all, I&#8217;m glad that there&#8217;s more publicity and <a href="http://www.onipress.com/graphicnovels/gn.php?id=116">the next volume in less than a month</a>. I just want to spread the love, but seriously, there have to be lines!</p>
<p>And to prove I&#8217;m even more of a neurotic geek, although I don&#8217;t know how much hipsterism ties in here, I&#8217;m not asking for Mal to show up in the comments and set me straight about what happened, because I&#8217;m conflicted enough about knowing not all comics creators I write about live in a magical blog-free realm where nothing I say has any meaning. I just thought a good confession might make me feel better about this. And while I&#8217;m on this cleansing topic, <cite class="Books">Jonathan Strange &#038; Mr. Norrell</cite> <a href="http://www.longstoryshortpier.com/vaults/2004/11/28/magic_tricks">doesn&#8217;t need a sequel</a>. The end. (or is it?)
