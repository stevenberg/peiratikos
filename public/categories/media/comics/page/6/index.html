<div class="text">
<p>The only comic book I&#8217;ve read recently is <cite class="Comics">JLA Classified</cite>, which is a fun superhero comic, a slippery polysemic critique of US foreign policy, a parody of the grim (and <em>dull</em>) superteam pastiches of <cite class="Comics">The Authority</cite> and <cite class="Comics">The Ultimates</cite>, and a playful subversion of Batman&#8217;s coherence as a character. <a href="http://gutterninja.blogspot.com/2004/11/this-universe-aint-big-enough-for-both.html"><cite class="People">Steve Pheley</cite></a> quotes <a href="http://www.thefourthrail.com/reviews/critiques/110104/jlaclassified1.shtml"><cite class="People">Don MacPherson</cite></a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.thefourthrail.com/reviews/critiques/110104/jlaclassified1.shtml"><p>The problem isn&#8217;t that this Batman is different, it&#8217;s that Morrison tries to maintain both are the same man. &#8220;I&#8217;m opening the sci-fi closet, Alfred. Don&#8217;t tell my friends in the G.C.P.D. about this.&#8221; The notion that the Batman who patrols Gotham, trying to prevent the sort of tragedy that scarred him as a youth, would have a box full of seemingly magical toys just doesn&#8217;t wash. [&#8230;] It took me out of the story.</p></blockquote>
<p>to which Steve replies cogently:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://gutterninja.blogspot.com/2004/11/this-universe-aint-big-enough-for-both.html"><p>Me, I tend to think it&#8217;s perfectly valid to have Solo Batman and JLA Batman being different, and blurring the lines between the two is fine if the tone of the story allows it (as the <cite>Classified</cite> story does). Call it Hypertime, call it selective continuity, call it fudging &#8212; why not, if you can get a good story out of it?</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It took me out of the story.&#8221; &#8220;It took me out of the story.&#8221; When people say this, I feel like Brad Stand in <cite class="Movies">I &hearts; Huckabees</cite>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>People</dt>
<dd>&#8220;It took me out of the story.&#8221;</dd>
<dt>Me</dt>
<dd>&#8220;That is so not true. Wait, what does that even <em>mean</em>?&#8221;</dd>
</dl>
<p>What are people doing in the story in the first place? They&#8217;re readers, not characters. OK, I&#8217;m being deliberately obtuse. But people talk about being immersed in the story, forgetting they&#8217;re reading a book or watching a movie. That can&#8217;t be what they mean. How could they really forget that they&#8217;re scanning a sequence of words (or images) on a page, or that they&#8217;re watching a sequence of images projected on a screen? And &#8220;willing suspension of disbelief.&#8221; I think people don&#8217;t mean this literally&#8212;how could they, and why would they want to, believe that the story they&#8217;re reading is true?&#8212;but the language of forgetfulness and belief seems unhelpful, at least for me. I want to remember, not forget, that I&#8217;m reading a text.</p>
<p>This language must be related to that some people hate criticism and analysis of texts. They complain that dissecting a text takes all the fun out of it&#8212;maybe because it forces them to abandon their strategies of immersive forgetfulness and belief, which seem childish and na&iuml;ve to me.

<div class="text">
<p>I&#8217;m not very good with promises, but I&#8217;m aiming for one blog update per weekend (and I hope one during the week, but we&#8217;ll see) just to keep me going, because this has been an unexpectedly taxing autumn. To prove I can keep promises after a fashion, though, I once told <a href="http://www.highclearing.com/"><cite class="People">Jim Henley</cite></a> I&#8217;d write more about <a href="https://peiratikos.net/archives/2004/06/08/filthy-beginnings/">my thoughts on <cite class="Comics">The Filth</cite> and gender</a>.  And while I&#8217;m on a roll, I asked <a href="http://fanboyrampage.blogspot.com/"><cite class="People">Graeme McMillan</cite></a> whether he thought Rosie in the remake of <cite class="Movies">The Manchurian Candidate</cite> was a good guy, a bad guy, or neither, but <a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/jjakala/messages/?msg=862.3">I never responded with my thoughts</a>.</p>
<p>Rectifying two old birds with one stone, in quasi-realistic situations (and it&#8217;s not entirely clear to me why I put <cite>The Filth</cite> in this class) we expect the good guys to avoid trading sex for information. OK, it&#8217;s entirely possible that this is just me and that the rest of the world assumes that the FBI adheres to James Bond standards of sexual involvement and intrigue, but I think not. And so in <cite>The Manchurian Candidate</cite> it set off alarms for me that Rosie was willing to become (I assume sexually) intimate with Ben to be a part of his deepest secrets. We see her doing other things like being involved in evidence tampering that make it seems she&#8217;s not interested in preserving truth and encouraging justice, at least as those terms are generally used. And then at the end of the movie she&#8217;s still with Ben at the scene of the crime that thrust him into this whole mess, and he&#8217;s letting some memory-heavy artifacts wash out to sea. Is she at his side because she really came to love this broken man she met on the train, this man she spied on and comforted? Is this part of her job, to keep him whole enough that he can finish the job of putting this plot in the past? Or is something more sinister going on? Sure, her work helps bring down members of the Manchurian Corp. conspiracy, but in a movie where every conspiracy is linked to something deeper and more far-reaching, why should we believe that this pulls out a root? Could she be working for some even more shadowy group to defuse this conspiracy and take control of Ben? Her demeanor doesn&#8217;t change from when she&#8217;s pretending to love him so she can keep him under surveillance to the time when she tracks him down at the scene of the assassination to their farewell to the past at the seaside ruins. Something strange is going on here, and it&#8217;s not just that she seems to use sex or even (worse?) love as a weapon but that this is so mundane. Perhaps it is in the normal world, although I don&#8217;t think many people could pull it off as calmly as Rosie seems to, but I think we hold our national security folks to higher standards, or at least I do.</p>
<p>And that brings me to a slight aside, which is that I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s meaningless that I&#8217;m talking about female spies here. This is not Mata Hari-style seduction but is still a power play in a way that perhaps James Bond dalliances aren&#8217;t. After all, Rosie doesn&#8217;t have signature drinks or swank suits or anything obvious at all, but it&#8217;s the conspicuous lack of anything extraordinary, a seeming sweet absence of guile in a movie where everyone else churns with intrigue, that makes her suspicious. But sometimes it&#8217;s just the gender patterns that are suspicious. In gearing up for <cite class="People">Neal Stephenson</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Books">The Confusion</cite>, which I read this weekend, I reread his <cite class="Books">The Diamond Age</cite> last weekend. One of the strangest episodes, and one that has soured the book for me a bit each time I&#8217;ve read it, involves a cult called The Drummers who live in a sleeplike state under the sea while their dreaming minds interact to form a sort of metaphorical computer. They carry particles in their bloodstreams that enhance this process and they can exchange these particles through intercourse, basically sharing smart STDs. The way this is carried out is that periodically there will be all sorts of drumming and then a woman becomes the center of attention and men dance around her. Eventually, after much buildup, each of the men has sex with her in front of the whole group, during which time she gets hotter and hotter because each of these little viruses raises blood temperature, until eventually she explodes and releases the viruses like spores and the men have picked up her viruses and so it keeps on spreading. Now, the book never says that this is how it always works, but it also never shows us a man being this exploding vessel in the several times we see the scene played out. To me, that&#8217;s telling in the same way that it&#8217;s telling that Rosie&#8217;s mother/lover act seemed uncontroversial. If the genders in <cite>The Manchurian Candidate</cite> had been reversed and Ross had seduced Beth to be able to keep an eye on her and keep her out of trouble, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m the only one who would have found it weird and problematic.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m not sure what to make of this issue in <cite>The Filth</cite>. The way Greg/Ned changes from nobody to superspy is through psychedelic sex with agent Miami. But how does she change over, then? And is this in her job description? That&#8217;s what I kept thinking as I read, wondering whether she enjoyed this aspect of things, this being a virus that translates a man into part of a larger being/organization and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any way to know. <a href="http://www.highclearing.com/archivesuo/week_2004_05_30.html#005401">Jim</a> wanted to know whether female characters were fully realized enough for female readers to make guesses about their motives and so on, and while right now I can&#8217;t look at the book because I&#8217;ve lent it to a friend who is probably reading this and feeling guilty, I can say that I wished I knew better what was going on in Miami&#8217;s mind, but that we never really knew what was going on in any of the character&#8217;s heads. If Jim&#8217;s theory that the women are all playing almost archetypal roles of what men expect from them, maybe that&#8217;s why the absence of Miami&#8217;s viewpoint seemed more poignant than that of the unnamed female Dreamers or Rosie, who at least seems to have a mind of her own in there somewhere. At the core of this, for me at least, is curiosity about to what extent sex like this is fully consensual for the (admittedly fictional) women involved. If it&#8217;s your job to have sex with guys to make them remember how cool they really are, do you hate your job? I realize I&#8217;m probably making too much of this, but it&#8217;s something that stuck out enough that I still think of it months later and I really don&#8217;t know what the answers are. I do know I&#8217;m probably having a nonstandard response to all of this, but I accept that too. I just think it&#8217;s interesting that sexual ethics don&#8217;t necessarily follow the same track as political ethics (or perhaps, in <cite>The Filth</cite> at least, they do) or professional ethics and yet this disconnect is commonplace enough that I haven&#8217;t seen people commenting on it. I suppose once this is posted, though, I will have, and that&#8217;s what counts.</p>
<p><strong>31 October 2004 Update Just to be clear, since I&#8217;m pretty sure I didn&#8217;t say this outright, I have no problems whatsoever with people choosing to trade sex for whatever they like, although my general ideal is that everyone should be as close to fully aware and fully consenting as possible. I do think it&#8217;s problematic for employers to expect their employees to have sex as part of their work, especially if this is something expected only of female employees. And if, in the case of <cite>The Manchurian Candidate</cite>, we assume that this is Our Tax Dollars at work, I imagine that would ruffle some feathers too. But I&#8217;m not trying to be anti-sex or opposed to these texts in general, because I think their creators were trying to grapple with just these sorts of messy issues and I&#8217;m glad that they did as it gave me something to think about and post.</strong>

You can even send art, in which case you&#8217;ll be in the running for a swank watercolor by creator <a href="http://www.radiomaru.com/">Bryan Lee O&#8217;Malley</a> in addition to the regular prizes, copies of <cite class="Comics">Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s Precious Little Life</cite>.</p>
<p>Got that? If you are reading this, able to receive mail, and interested in <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite>, you&#8217;ve got nothing to lose and potentially a rollicking good read to gain if all goes well for you.  Consider yourselves duly warned.

<p>There have been some updates to the <a href="https://peiratikos.net/archives/2004/10/16/scott-pilgrim-contest/"><cite class="Comics">Scott Pilgrim</cite> contest</a>, viz.</p>
<ul>
<li>Just to be clear: the Scott Pilgrim contest is open to everyone in the world????????well, everyone who lives in a country with a working postal system, at least. Also, fellow bloggers are welcome to enter the contest.</li>
<li>Bryan has kindly offered a watercolor drawing as an additional prize. That would make a good prize for special art entries! Note that an art component isn????????t a required part of the contest, but if anybody feels like making a cool Scott Pilgrim-related drawing????????a drawing of I don????????t know what, since this is a contest for people who haven????????t read the book, but that????????s part of the challenge, I guess????????then one talented artist will receive the Special Art Appreciation Prize.</li>

<p><strong>21 October 2004 Update (by Steven): Just to be clear: the <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite> contest is open to everyone in the world&#8212;well, everyone who lives in a country with a working postal system, at least. Also, fellow bloggers are welcome to enter the contest.</strong></p>
<p><strong>18 October 2004 Update (by Steven): Bryan has kindly offered a watercolor drawing as an additional prize. That would make a good prize for special art entries!

<p>So, you&#8217;ve heard about <cite class="Comics">Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s Precious Little Life</cite> but haven&#8217;t nabbed a copy yet. Volume 2 will be released in February, so now&#8217;s the time to get caught up with the story so far, and we at <a href="https://peiratikos.net/">Peiratikos</a> have your chance to get in on the fun.  You have until 5 November, 2004 to email us at <a href="mailto:contest@peiratikos.net">contest@peiratikos.net</a> to let us know <strong>why you think you would like <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite></strong> for a chance to win the fairly obvious prize: your own copy of <cite>Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s Precious Little Life</cite>. The grand prize winner will also get an XL tshirt, assuming they&#8217;re still available then. And for the artists, outstanding visual work may receive a special award.</p>
<p>And how will you know if <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite> is right for you? The one-stop clearing house for all things Scott is <a href="http://www.scottpilgrim.com/">Scott Pilgrim dot Com</a>, where you can read reviews and view some fan art and hear what creator <a href="http://www.radiomaru.com/"><cite class="People">Bryan Lee O&#8217;Malley</cite></a> has to say. And since I might as well hype myself while I&#8217;m hyping Scott Pilgrim, you can see what O&#8217;Malley said to me in particular in <a href="https://peiratikos.net/archives/2004/10/15/mal-interview/">my interview with him</a>. More interviews are available in links from <a href="http://www.scottpilgrim.com/">ScottPilgrim.com</a>, too.</p>
<p>Want more looking and less talking? Get a taste of the story in two previews: a <a href="http://www.onipress.com/retailers/SCOTTPILGRIM-PREVIEW.pdf"><acronym title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym> document</a> from <a href="http://www.onipress.com">Oni Press</a> or a <a href="http://www.icomics.com/rev_080904_scottpilgrim.shtml">web-based preview</a> from <a href="http://www.icomics.com/">iComics</a>.</p>
<p>And as a reminder for faithful blog readers, comics bloggers discuss<cite class="Comics"> Scott Pilgrim</cite>, although there are often spoilers: </p>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://comics.212.net/2004_08_01_archive.shtml#109225113993342371"><cite class="People">Chris Butcher</cite></a>, of <a href="http://comics.212.net">Comics.212.net</a>, who  is personally invested and thus talks about <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite> every chance he gets.</li>

</ul>
<p>And that&#8217;s it for now, I think. It doesn&#8217;t matter why you haven&#8217;t read <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite> yet, because all we need to know is what makes you want to read it. It&#8217;s that easy, and three potential readers with the best arguments will win copies of the comic. And the grand prize winner will leave with a <a href="http://scottpilgrim.com/images/head_colors.jpg">shirt</a>, too! Just email your heart-wrenching tale to us at <a href="mailto:contest@peiratikos.net">contest@peiratikos.net</a> and then look for winning entries to be posted soon after the Friday, 5 November deadline.
