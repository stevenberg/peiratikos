<p>What&#8217;s up with Scots and psychedelia anyway? I decided to take a night off <cite class="People">Grant Morrison</cite> to seam up the shirt I&#8217;ve been knitting and generally lounge around, which meant I finally got to watch my new copy of <cite class="People">The Incredible String Band</cite> movie, <cite class="Movies">Be Glad for the Song Has No Ending</cite>. My mother watched, alternately amused and chagrined by her own memories, since it was her records that had made me a fan of the band in the first place. In fact, I&#8217;m not only a fan of the String Band, but I think many of the musicians I&#8217;ve come to like since share common traits with them, most notably <cite class="People">Robyn Hitchcock</cite> and <cite class="People">Rose Polenzani</cite>.</p>
<p>But I felt like a fool watching a movie that far predates me of a band that disbanded before I was born, because my first thought was, &#8220;They look so <i>young</i>!&#8221; And they were young and blooming with exuberance and honesty and songs I love, making it an endearing movie. One thing I noticed quickly was the way my relationship to The Psychedelic has changed since I was a teenager. Then I was mostly put off by the idea of drug use, which hasn&#8217;t particularly changed, but there wasn&#8217;t any of that visible in the film anyway, and I don&#8217;t know to what extent it was a part of their reality. Instead what I realized is that I&#8217;d been intrigued and repelled by psychedelic imagery because some of the ideas resonated with me but they were couched in what seemed to be nonsense gibberish. And at that point I realized I hadn&#8217;t avoided thinking about Morrison at all.</p>
<p>See, stories in which magical drug insights give a character (or author, I suppose) insight into reality-as-it-is always seemed unsatisfying to me. Morrison seemed to undercut the sincere spirit journey version in <cite class="Comics">Animal Man</cite> with all the scenes in <cite class="Comics">The Invisibles</cite> that suggest that while you can believe you&#8217;ve taken a drug, you can never trust yourself to believe you&#8217;re in reality. <cite>New X-Men</cite> has an awkward anti-drug slant, and drugs other than sex and reality seem to be basically absent from <cite>The Filth</cite>, which is odd. OK, they&#8217;re not absent, but they&#8217;re not consciousness-altering either. Tony needs his cat medicine, though what medicine and for what condition is both unclear and crucial. And the president has to take drugs to become a crack whore, so I&#8217;m not sure if that means the drugs he takes bring him into closer contact with his <i>real</i> self or not. And then there&#8217;s the medical marijuana sequence at the end, in which a guy who nearly killed himself while stoned prolongs his painful status quo (and maybe dulls the pain) with more drugs. So apparently I was crazy in thinking drugs don&#8217;t figure in much, but it still seems odd to me that drugs don&#8217;t show up more in the filth of the world than they do. I guess it&#8217;s still significant that they don&#8217;t seem to bring any extra awareness or sensitivity and that just living &#8220;normally&#8221; clouds your mind too.</p>
<p>What I found revealing about <cite>Be Glad</cite> was that contrary to what I&#8217;d gathered from their songs, The Incredible String Band didn&#8217;t believe there were lots of gods in the world. They believed they <em>were</em> gods, creating for their own enjoyment and amusement, and audience was of little concern. I like being ignored like that, because it means they don&#8217;t bother to pander to me. It might be that this is what Grant Morrison does too. <a href="https://peiratikos.net/archive/2004/06/08/filthy-beginnings/#comment-360">Some</a> <a href="https://peiratikos.net/archive/2004/06/08/filthy-beginnings/#comment-357">readers</a> think what he does is just playing with whatever he finds intriguing at the time, and I can&#8217;t totally disagree. I just think I have enough overlap that the ideas remain interesting without so much that I find them trite, but I guess the question is whether this matters to Morrison. It only matters to me inasmuch as I&#8217;ve described; the way he writes is interesting to me, and so I stay interested, not very exciting. And sometimes I think he fails completely at synthesizing things, and that&#8217;s interesting too. But while The Incredible String Band was not commercial (or at least I hope they didn&#8217;t have commercial aspirations, since their fame was fleeting) and could stand to say heartfelt but unhelpful things to Newsweek interviewers, beaming while their girlfriends embroidered tunics in the background, Morrison is making a real living writing comics and doing fairly well. Does  this mean he has an obligation to give his audience what it wants? My standard answer when this question arises in comics is that that would be a horrible idea, because I really don&#8217;t want to see Wolverine battling a set of breasts the size of Connecticut. But obviously Morrison has to take audience into account to some degree if he wants to make any money, and I really don&#8217;t know how he or others manage this. </p>
<p>So I didn&#8217;t talk about <cite>The Filth</cite> much, but that&#8217;s because this was a night to think about what it means to be creating a good world in art and in life. I&#8217;m never sure I&#8217;m up to it, but there also doesn&#8217;t seem to be an acceptable alternative. And there&#8217;s another gnomic statement you can use to sum up <cite>The Filth</cite>. Perhaps I ought to start collecting them, and maybe that would be a start.</p>
<p>And I bid you good night.

<p>If any comics publishers read this, hear my cry in the wilderness: we need page numbers! This is a serious problem in comics publishing. In my experience, DC is the only publisher that consistently produces books with numbered pages. Marvel books <em>never</em> have page numbers, not even the <acronym title="trade paperback">TPB</acronym>s. I just flipped through all the Image and Dark Horse I found lying around&#8212;no page numbers. I pulled out a couple other books published outside the major American publishers&#8212;the only one I can find with page numbers is <cite class="Comics">Persepolis</cite>. Thank you <cite class="People">Marjane Satrapi</cite>! I&#8217;ve just flipped through about ten comic books and only one of them has numbered pages!</p>
<p>My problem here is, I&#8217;ve decided to be better about citations in my critical writing. Among other things, this means I&#8217;d like to cite page numbers of books. This, of course, is very difficult when the books have no page numbers. It&#8217;s not too bad with Marvel books, since they&#8217;re usually collected reprints of single issues and I can just count from the beginning of each issue rather than the beginning of the entire book. But I just read <cite class="Comics">Couscous Express</cite> (published by the blogosphere&#8217;s favorite &#8216;indie&#8217; publisher <a href="http://www.ait-planetlar.com/">Ait/Planetlar</a>), and I&#8217;d like to write about it, and I&#8217;d like to cite page numbers when I reference specific passages&#8212;but it has no page numbers! And there are no chapter divisions, so I&#8217;ll have to count myself from the very beginning of the book. I&#8217;ll probably get a pen and write in my own page numbers, but I shouldn&#8217;t have to do that. Comics creators and publishers, please number the pages of your books!

<p><cite class="People">Jim Henley</cite> wanted to know what women think of <cite class="Comics">The Filth</cite>. I finished it last night and I think it&#8217;s <cite class="People">Grant Morrison</cite> all right, and you&#8217;re not going to get much more out of me tonight, because my head is rebelling and I need medicine that works or, failing that, sleep. Ok, and what I need most of all is <strong>pictures of little kids with superimposed ants&#8217; heads</strong>. Lots. I very much need this. I suppose pictures of rotund fellows with eye-bellies would be acceptable, at least the utopian sort, but not as good.</p>
<p>Anyway, the reason Jim Henley wants to know what women think is that he&#8217;s worried (or perhaps not worried) that <a href="http://www.highclearing.com/archivesuo/week_2004_05_30.html#005401"><cite>The Filth</cite> is a guy thing</a>. I don&#8217;t have a good answer to that question. I&#8217;m not comfortable with the idea that women deal with filth and bodies more or earlier than men (speaking of course in huge generalizations) do. Yeah, yeah, we&#8217;ve got menstruation and the awkwardness of breasts and having to deal with being an object of attraction, and I&#8217;ve managed to make my peace with the first of those things at least. But even as a young adolescent when I wanted to be anything but feminine, I wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to have to deal with random erections and wet dreams and all that hideously sexual guy-stuff. Also booger jokes. Ugh. </p>
<p>I think maybe a keener difference lies in ownership of sexuality, though this probably relies on even grander generalizations. Especially when it comes to sexuality, men are trained to think they&#8217;re in control of themselves. I don&#8217;t know to what extent they believe this, but that seems to be the paradigm, and that makes it really difficult to have sexual assault training for men (and here I&#8217;m talking about college guys because this is all I&#8217;ve had to deal with) who think they could never be assaulted and are sure they and all their friends are nice guys who would never assault anyone else. One way people get around this problem is with a  horrible, offensive program that says to men, &#8220;Think how much you&#8217;d hate yourself if a man raped you! And imagine how you would feel if someone raped your girlfriend!&#8221; If the only way to remind men that they&#8217;re not in control is by calling on their ick-factor homophobia or urging them to be mindful of people they&#8217;re supposed to own, that&#8217;s not a good state of affairs. But that&#8217;s to some degree what&#8217;s going on in <cite>The Filth</cite>. Male desire (and I think Jim&#8217;s right that women aren&#8217;t fleshed out in the story, but mostly in that they&#8217;re not protagonists even of their subplots much) has gotten out of control. Desire for control is taking over the world, and it&#8217;s up to the members of The Hand to be Super-Men, to assert control over the sexually power-mad men. Whether we&#8217;re dealing with bad guys releasing hordes of super sperm that seem to destroy rather than impregnate their targets or goodish guys who don&#8217;t bother to close the window when masturbating to copious porn and don&#8217;t notice the porn in the street, or even possibly unreal has-beens who while away the hours watching their wives engage in hardcore sex with all their old friends and foes, we&#8217;re dealing with some ugly stuff and unpleasant guys. So what makes this a Guy Book? Is it because it&#8217;s a chance to explore otherwise hidden frailties while still sympathizing with the powerful main character(s)? Is it because it&#8217;s a chance to say, &#8220;Hee! Erection jokes! Prison rape jokes!&#8221; without noticing that their unqualified acceptance isn&#8217;t really supported by the text? </p>
<p>I dunno. I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s not why Jim liked it, or <a href="http://theintermittent.blogspot.com/2004_06_01_theintermittent_archive.html#108619573930156951"><cite class="People">Dave Intermittent</cite></a> or <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1084538952#275189"><cite class="People">David Fiore</cite></a> or <cite class="People">Steven</cite>, but I&#8217;m not sure if they have peculiarly gendered responses. I liked <cite>The Filth</cite>, too, though I think I prefer the pretentiousness of <cite class="Comics">The Invisibles</cite>. That I&#8217;m not entirely sure may be a sign I&#8217;m skewing toward the center of the mind/body scale, our Little Rose growing up! Not hating my body was an important, difficult lesson to learn, but I still don&#8217;t love or privilege it either. </p>
<p>And thinking of hating my body brings me back to my impending migraine and thus departure, with assurances that more commentary will come in time. That <cite>Animal Man</cite> stuff is still in my head, too, while I&#8217;m making rash promises, but no more for tonight nor tomorrow, when I watch my brother test his physicality in the all-star game, the end of his high-school football career. He spent four years wallowing in sweat and bruises and bashing, and that&#8217;s all Filth to me. I&#8217;ll be the bitchy one aching in the bleachers.

<div class="text">
<p>(<cite class="Comics">Demo</cite> is a pretty good comic book by <cite class="People">Brian Wood</cite> and <cite class="People">Becky Cloonan</cite>. After the discussion about issue #6 at <a href="http://johnnybacardi.blogspot.com/2004_06_01_johnnybacardi_archive.html#108621105361528344"><cite class="People">David Allen Jones</cite>&#8217;s blog</a>, I figured it was time to do a closer rereading. Since the pages in <cite>Demo</cite> #6 aren&#8217;t numbered, I&#8217;m counting starting at the first page after the inside cover.)</p>
<p>Ken thinks his problem as a kid was small-town American xenophobia. Reminiscing on the day he sent an army of zombie pets after his entire neighborhood, he asks, &#8220;Did they deserve it?&#8221; (p. 23). Ah, Ken, wrong question&#8230; It&#8217;s obfuscated by the racism angle, but what poor little Ken seems to suffer is the same suburban ennui and fear of conformity that Lester Burnham felt in <cite class="Movies">American Beauty</cite>, a dis-ease which is utterly terrifying to Ken (and Lester) and utterly banal to every other suburbanite who felt it and decided to do something other than whine or act pretentiously nutty. Ken&#8217;s real problem is his inability to take action to end his bad life. He thinks his problems are anybody&#8217;s fault but his. &#8220;Then there was my mom. I know she tried. But she was just as miserable and angry and out of place as I was&#8221; (p. 8). &#8220;But I know Dad tried too. It just wasn&#8217;t enough, I guess&#8221; (pp. 9-10). Even Ken&#8217;s happiness becomes the responsibility of others: &#8220;The only person that looked like me weeded the neighbor&#8217;s lawn. I never knew his name or even spoke to him, but he always made me feel better somehow&#8221; (pp. 6-7). (Ken&#8217;s claim that he never spoke to the gardener turns out to be incorrect [pp. 20-21], which is only the most obvious signal that he&#8217;s far from a reliable narrator.)</p>
<p>The ability to raise and control zombie pets is, of course, a great power for a guy like Ken who likes to displace responsibility. Ken wants revenge? Hey, he doesn&#8217;t have to get his hands dirty, let the dogs do it. He always had his dog to <em>make</em> him &#8220;feel better&#8221; (p. 14), but when one of those mean neighbors kills it, the dog becomes an instrument of vengeance. &#8220;&#8230;as much as my dog once helped me control my anger, he now helped me focus it&#8221; (p. 15). Ken is so passive himself, he&#8217;s passing the buck for his emotions on to his pet dog. The art focuses on horrific images of ghostly skeletal figures, zombies clawing out of the ground, violent death, but this is more displacement. The real horror is Ken&#8217;s passivity and retreat from the world.</p>
<p>But then, while Ken may be displacing his revenge onto the zombie pets, it&#8217;s still the most proactive measure he&#8217;s ever taken. The massive zombie devestation could be a terrible moment of insight that jolts Ken out of his loser world, but even as the power surges through him he can&#8217;t give up his lack of control. His one conversation with the gardener is brief: the gardener admonishes, &#8220;You should stop now. Hate will eat you too,&#8221; and Ken replies, &#8220;OK&#8221; (pp. 20-21).</p>
<p>Ken foolishly takes the gardener&#8217;s advice as the moral of the story:</p>
<blockquote><p>I remember that day well enough. The one day I lost control, the one day I got mad. The <i>one day</i> I let those feelings out (p. 23). It&#8217;s staring me right in the face [over an image of Ken&#8217;s resurrected dog, looking up at Ken]. That gardner [sic] was right, hate will eat you up, if you let it. I stopped in time, and yeah, life is good now. But I will never forget how close I came (p. 25).</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, is that a cop out or what? Here Ken has just lied to his wife about why his childhood neighborhood is an abandoned wreck. Because the text jumps from the frame story with Ken as an adult to the flashback with Ken as a child, and because it conspicuously refuses to fill in any information about the intervening years, and because Ken is hardly a reliable narrator, there&#8217;s not much reason to believe him when he claims &#8220;life is good now,&#8221; that he narrowly escaped tumbling into the abyss and is now happy and healthy. The narration is flat and simplistic (&#8221;I got sad. Mom cried. Dad got <i>super</i> mad. Then I got scared and embarrassed&#8221; [p. 11])&#8212;has Ken reverted to childlike narration for the flashback, or does he still actually think like that, as an adult? Why doesn&#8217;t he grow up and deal with his real problems? Oh, but then he&#8217;d have to tell his wife about them&#8230; And why does he decide not to do that? To protect her from his dark past? or just to avoid confronting them himself? No, there&#8217;s nothing good about Ken&#8217;s life now, and his wife is just another responsibility-displacement tool.</p>
<p>(<a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1086361018#286615"><cite class="People">David Fiore</cite> has a somewhat similar reading</a>, over at his own blog:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://ynot.motime.com/1086361018#286615"><p>&#8230;when you make a person you love cry, it&#8217;s not &#8220;society&#8217;s&#8221; fault, it&#8217;s <i>yours</i>. I would assume that goes at least double for mass-murder! And man, if you aren&#8217;t willing to look your past victims in the eye&#8212;just don&#8217;t bother looking at all, because the objects back there are much <i>farther</i> away than they seem, unless you have the benefit of another person&#8217;s perspective to help you find the range.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also compares the story to the film <cite class="Movies">The Strange Love of Martha Ivers</cite>.)

<div class="text">
<p>Plenty of people in the comics blogosphere seem to love <cite class="Comics">The Losers</cite>, so when Rose and I found a copy of <cite class="Comics">The Losers: Ante Up</cite> at Half-Price Books for $5, we figured it was worth checking out. This is an art-driven book, which is to say, I wouldn&#8217;t want to read it if I didn&#8217;t like the art. It&#8217;s not that <cite class="People">Andy Diggle</cite>&#8217;s writing is bad&#8212;I see his job as inventing cool stuff for <cite class="People">Jock</cite> to draw and filling the necessary speech balloons with tolerable dialogue, and he does his job just fine. The bad-ass quips are only occasionally cringe-worthy. &#8220;Candy, meet baby,&#8221; after the Losers cleverly escape yet another inescapable deathtrap, is the most unforgivable (N.B. to writers, glib rewordings of clich????s always come off badly). The left-leaning politics are pretty mild (apparently the CIA really does run drugs into the United States, they really do hire evil mercenaries to do their dirty work, they really are still selling illegal weapons to Saudia Arabia, the government really care only about oil, etc.), but I suppose they may seem more radical in the current political climate in which thin-skinned Republicans yelp whenever anybody Undermines the War Effort by questioning Bush administration foreign policies. But whatever, at any rate, I suppose I prefer the mildly liberal action of <cite>The Losers</cite> to the dumb Republican action of <cite class="Movies">True Lies</cite> and other action movies starring <cite class="People">Arnold Schwarzenegger</cite> and <cite class="People">Bruce Willis</cite>.</p>
<p>The characters are ciphers. The guys are all gruff but sociable action heroes, each with his own specialty: Cougar the sniper, Jensen the hacker, Pooch the driver, Clay the leader. Of course, the one exception is Roque, the asshole who never stops whining and never actually does anything useful. Aisha is the most intriguing characer simply because she gets to be a different kind of cipher than the rest: the silent loner. The sort of character who, in fanfic written by 14-year-olds, would be a seven-foot-tall man in a black trenchcoat, but Andy Diggle is clever enough to make his silent loner a crazy ninja woman from the Hindu Kush.</p>
<p>This is all fine. So far, <cite>The Losers</cite> is the kind of story whose plot ticks along like a well-oiled clockwork machine. The expert precision of the characters should be paralled in the expert precision of the authors as they construct the plot, and Diggle, Jock et al. do a fine job of it. I usually prefer my action-centered narratives to dig deeper and get a hold of that bloody human nastiness clogging up the clockwork, like <cite class="Movies">Rififi</cite> or <cite class="Movies">Three Kings</cite>. And I usually like my slick caper stories to be more like <cite class="Movies">Ocean&#8217;s Eleven</cite>, longer on the witty repartee and shorter on the violent mayhem. And as a veteran of <cite class="Television">The X-Files</cite>, I carry in my heart a lovingly nurtured resentment and suspicion of longform serialized conspiracy adventures. And (last one!) as a veteran of <cite class="Books">Foucault&#8217;s Pendulum</cite>, I&#8217;m just not that impressed by most conspiracy theories anymore. <cite>The Losers</cite>, alas, hasn&#8217;t (yet) dug very deep, it&#8217;s long on the violence and a little too short on the witty repartee, and it&#8217;s very much in the just-what-we-needed-another-evil-government-conspiracy genre. Ah, but I&#8217;ve read only the first six issues, and those are just entertaining enough to make me wonder if I should keep on keeping on with it.</p>
<p>And since I started writing this post (two days ago) by saying I wouldn&#8217;t want to read it if I didn&#8217;t like the art, I think what I meant was that the plot of <cite>The Losers</cite> isn&#8217;t quite as well-oiled as it should be, but the art (especially the supercool coloring by <cite class="People">Lee Loughridge</cite>, which is my favorite part of the book) is pretty enough to make up for it. Just thought I should clarify, since I wrote the first half of this post two days ago and the second half just now and I&#8217;m not sure they fit together.

<div class="text">
<p>There&#8217;s some good discussion of <cite class="Comics">Demo</cite> #6 on <a href="http://johnnybacardi.blogspot.com/2004_06_01_johnnybacardi_archive.html#108621105361528344"><cite class="People">David Allen Jones</cite>&#8217;s Johnny Bacardi blog</a>, including some comments from <cite>Demo</cite> writer <cite class="People">Brian Wood</cite>. The problem with artists making exegeses of their own work is that it&#8217;s always disappointing when you disagree with them, especially when you&#8217;ve just come up with a reading that you think makes sense of a text that was bothering you and the author disagrees with your reading. I&#8217;m not too worried about whether my interpretations of texts matches up with &#8216;authorial intent,&#8217; but it still makes me a little less inclined to enjoy a text when I have confirmation that the author&#8217;s intent was to create something I <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> enjoy. Oh well, though! I think I may enjoy <cite>Demo</cite> #6 more next time I read it, but I don&#8217;t know yet because I haven&#8217;t reread it yet! Until I reread, here&#8217;s what I think right now, direct from the Johnny B comment thread. <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments.php?user=jbacardi&#038;comment=108621105361528344#203769"><cite class="People">David Fiore</cite></a> said:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.haloscan.com/comments.php?user=jbacardi&#038;comment=108621105361528344#203769"><p>The work is the work, and there&#8217;s always a way to connect any two points within a story&#8217;s structure. In my case, I&#8217;ve concluded that Ken is more dangerous in the frame than he ever was as a child&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Which <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments.php?user=jbacardi&#038;comment=108621105361528344#203997">makes me</a> <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments.php?user=jbacardi&#038;comment=108621105361528344#203998">think</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.haloscan.com/comments.php?user=jbacardi&#038;comment=108621105361528344"><p>Is Ken more dangerous as an adult than he ever was as a mass-murdering kid? Ken&#8217;s real problem seems to be getting caught up in his own story. I don&#8217;t have Demo #6 with me now, but I recall thinking as I read that the biggest problem in his childhood was that his daddy didn&#8217;t love him enough or was too weak to protect him from the world. Ken seems to have made the gardener into one of the magical wise old men Sean mentioned in the post Johnny B linked to, but the gardener doesn&#8217;t do much to deserve it&#8212;he remains remarkably calm while Ken is going around making undead pets eat everybody, but of course it&#8217;s Ken narrating and he doesn&#8217;t seem too reliable. Maybe Ken&#8217;s real superpower is inventing objects (his dad, the gardener, flesh-eating zombie puppies) that let him avoid dealing with himself. Ken may look like a well-adjusted happy newlywed, but has anything really changed in his life? Is his wife just another responsibility-deflecting tool?</p></blockquote>

<div class="text">
<p>Over in the comments thread of <a href="http://ottoscoffeeshop.blogspot.com/2004_05_23_ottoscoffeeshop_archive.html#108568030476835988"><cite class="People">Jeff Chatlos</cite>&#8217;s post about why so many people don&#8217;t read comics</a>, Jeff asks <cite class="People">Rose</cite>:</p>
<blockquote cite=""><p>Rose: I&#8217;m VERY interested to hear what got you interested in comics in your 20s, and what your perceptions are as a latecomer. I look forward to reading what you have to say, either here or at your blog.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not, in fact, Rose, but I also started reading comics when I was 20 years old (about two years ago), and I&#8217;ve had some thoughts lately about how this affects my perception of all things comics. Actually, it&#8217;s partly Rose&#8217;s fault I started. I think the first comic I read as an adult was <cite class="Comics">Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again</cite>, specifically the Wonder Woman-Superman sex scene. Rose and a friend of ours showed this to me, I have no idea why. (That was also when I first learned that superhero comics aren&#8217;t just for kids anymore. I was barely aware Superman comics were being published, let alone ones in which he and Wonder Woman destroyed mountains wth their mighty orgasms.) The second comic I read was <cite class="Comics">Transmetropolitan</cite>. I&#8217;m not sure why, but I think because it was just about the first comic I heard of that wasn&#8217;t a superhero comic and I was intrigued by the idea. At first I avoided superhero comics because I figured they were probably pretty dumb, but then Rose made me read <cite class="Comics">Young Justice</cite> and next thing you know here I am with a copy of <cite class="Comics">Crisis on Infinite Earths</cite> on my bookshelf.</p>
<p>Now, first of all, the fact that I began reading comics as an adult means I don&#8217;t have the baggage of exposure to <cite class="People">Rob Liefeld</cite> at an impressionable age. I suspect a great deal of the &#8220;Superheroes are for kids, quit reading that crap!&#8221; criticism I see is driven by the deep-seated embarrassment of people who read <cite class="Comics">X-Force</cite> when they were kids. On the other hand, it also means I never developed a childlike emotional attachment to any characters. This seems to be a fairly common criticism of adult &#8216;fanboys,&#8217; that they&#8217;re emotionally stunted losers who continue to read superhero comics because they&#8217;re obsessed with Superman. In fact, I avoided superhero comics (motivated by exactly the sorts of stereotypes I mention now) until Rose showed me some good ones. At the same time, she gave me lots of non-superhero comics (e.g. <cite class="Comics">Kabuki</cite>) and small-press and minicomics. So I started reading as an adult with fairly sophisticated critical faculties, I expected superhero comics to be bad by default, I had someone to expose me to a wide variety of comics and help me avoid the really bad stuff, I haven&#8217;t had a chance to get burnt out (which seems to happen rather frequently among longtime comics readers). I do think all this gives me an &#8216;advantage&#8217; over people who&#8217;ve read comics since they were children, in that I just haven&#8217;t had the opportunities to build up bad baggage with superhero comics. Now, if I <em>had</em> read <cite>X-Force</cite> as an impressionable young lad, would I now scorn superhero comics as childish trash? I have no idea, obviously, but I do think my late arrival to comics played a large role in non-scorn of superhero comics.

<h2 class="alt">Chaotic Believability</h2>

<p><strong><a href="http://flat_earth.blogspot.com/2004_05_23_flat_earth_archive.html#108547221824993470">Chaotic Believability</a>: </strong> <a href="https://peiratikos.net/archive/2004/05/25/continuity/">On the other hand</a>, <cite class="People">Steven Wintle</cite> calls the early Marvel Universe "chaotically believable": "...just when is the real world ever cohesive and consistent? The left hand rarely knows what the right hand is doing, and a variety of interpretations and slightly off-kilter continuity is the element of inadvertent, lo-fi surprise that can make shared universe superhero comics not only fun, but also somewhat chaotically believable." Now we can combine <a href="http://www.ninthart.com/display.php?article=851"><cite class="People">Paul O'Brien</cite></a>, <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1085449764#280654">David Fiore</a>, and Steven and say that the Marvel Universe is like the real world because the real world is the Text that we all must interpret.</p>
