<div class="text">
<p>The only comic book I&#8217;ve read recently is <cite class="Comics">JLA Classified</cite>, which is a fun superhero comic, a slippery polysemic critique of US foreign policy, a parody of the grim (and <em>dull</em>) superteam pastiches of <cite class="Comics">The Authority</cite> and <cite class="Comics">The Ultimates</cite>, and a playful subversion of Batman&#8217;s coherence as a character. <a href="http://gutterninja.blogspot.com/2004/11/this-universe-aint-big-enough-for-both.html"><cite class="People">Steve Pheley</cite></a> quotes <a href="http://www.thefourthrail.com/reviews/critiques/110104/jlaclassified1.shtml"><cite class="People">Don MacPherson</cite></a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.thefourthrail.com/reviews/critiques/110104/jlaclassified1.shtml"><p>The problem isn&#8217;t that this Batman is different, it&#8217;s that Morrison tries to maintain both are the same man. &#8220;I&#8217;m opening the sci-fi closet, Alfred. Don&#8217;t tell my friends in the G.C.P.D. about this.&#8221; The notion that the Batman who patrols Gotham, trying to prevent the sort of tragedy that scarred him as a youth, would have a box full of seemingly magical toys just doesn&#8217;t wash. [&#8230;] It took me out of the story.</p></blockquote>
<p>to which Steve replies cogently:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://gutterninja.blogspot.com/2004/11/this-universe-aint-big-enough-for-both.html"><p>Me, I tend to think it&#8217;s perfectly valid to have Solo Batman and JLA Batman being different, and blurring the lines between the two is fine if the tone of the story allows it (as the <cite>Classified</cite> story does). Call it Hypertime, call it selective continuity, call it fudging &#8212; why not, if you can get a good story out of it?</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It took me out of the story.&#8221; &#8220;It took me out of the story.&#8221; When people say this, I feel like Brad Stand in <cite class="Movies">I &hearts; Huckabees</cite>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>People</dt>
<dd>&#8220;It took me out of the story.&#8221;</dd>
<dt>Me</dt>
<dd>&#8220;That is so not true. Wait, what does that even <em>mean</em>?&#8221;</dd>
</dl>
<p>What are people doing in the story in the first place? They&#8217;re readers, not characters. OK, I&#8217;m being deliberately obtuse. But people talk about being immersed in the story, forgetting they&#8217;re reading a book or watching a movie. That can&#8217;t be what they mean. How could they really forget that they&#8217;re scanning a sequence of words (or images) on a page, or that they&#8217;re watching a sequence of images projected on a screen? And &#8220;willing suspension of disbelief.&#8221; I think people don&#8217;t mean this literally&#8212;how could they, and why would they want to, believe that the story they&#8217;re reading is true?&#8212;but the language of forgetfulness and belief seems unhelpful, at least for me. I want to remember, not forget, that I&#8217;m reading a text.</p>
<p>This language must be related to that some people hate criticism and analysis of texts. They complain that dissecting a text takes all the fun out of it&#8212;maybe because it forces them to abandon their strategies of immersive forgetfulness and belief, which seem childish and na&iuml;ve to me.

</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s probably not an exact quote, but I did my best to remember the dialogue from the closing scene of <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0751102/"><cite class="People">David O. Russell</cite>&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0356721/"><cite class="Movies">I &#9829; Huckabees</cite></a>. The &#8220;interconnection thing&#8221; is a.k.a. the Blanket Theory, of which the Jaffes, existential detectives, are the leading proponents: All the matter and energy in the universe are connected, everything affects everything else. If you think your life is bad&#8212;if, e.g., a middle manager in the Huckabees Corporation has invaded your environmentalist coalition and turned it into a PR vehicle, or if you&#8217;re a firefighter who&#8217;s been in the grip of existential crisis since &#8220;that big September thing&#8221;<a href="index.html#note-281-1"><sup id="ref-281-1">*</sup></a> and can&#8217;t stand all the hypocritical petroleum users calling you a hero&#8212;well, moments of traumatic crisis are the perfect opportunity to dismantle your alienated identity, look at the big picture, see the Blanket, and recognize your interconnectedness. Everything is the same even if it&#8217;s different. Your journey to enlightenment will bring a little more enlightenment to the entire universe. This is what Vivian and Bernard Jaffe are trying to show environmentalist and amateur poet Albert Markovski and firefighter Tommy Corn as they investigate their respective existential crises.</p>
<p>But&#8212;what <em>about</em> Brad Stand, the Huckabees executive who&#8217;s turned Albert&#8217;s coalition into a Huckabees promotional machine, and all those petroleum-using selfish people(for example, Tommy&#8217;s wife, who doesn&#8217;t <em>care</em> what life means and would prefer simply to live it, preferably without philosophers like Tommy hanging around)? If everything&#8217;s connected and everything&#8217;s great, why do Albert and Tommy keep getting fucked over by everybody around them? The Jaffes can&#8217;t answer that question for them. (Albert doesn&#8217;t really want them to&#8212;he only wants to know why he keeps coincidentally(?) running into the same African man&#8212;but Bernard Jaffe pushes him into examining the Blanket Theory, which leads to hard questions about the basic indecency of people that the Jaffes fail to answer to Albert&#8217;s satisfaction.) Who can answer it? Caterine Vauban, a French existentialist, archenemy of the Jaffes, who teaches Albert and Tommy her philosophy of &#8220;cruelty, manipulation, meaninglessness.&#8221; A state of pure being (what the Jaffes would think of as seeing the Blanket, but according to Vauban&#8217;s teaching involves getting hit in the face with a large rubber ball) is obtainable but ephemeral. Human drama is inevitable, and you&#8217;ll find yourself kicked out of your pure being as soon as, for example, your best friend and your philosophy instructor dump you to go have sex in the woods. Vauban&#8217;s pure being, contra the Jaffes, is pure disconnection from the universe, and her concept of human relationships leads inevitably to alienation&#8212;no Blanket here. Life is absurd.</p>
<p>The movie&#8217;s plot, then (and there is one), is dialectic, with Vauban&#8217;s nihilism the antithesis to the Jaffes&#8217; feel-good answer to the existentialist dilemma. Is there synthesis? Yes<a href="index.html#note-281-2"><sup id="ref-281-2">&#8224;</sup></a>, as Albert and Tommy work out in the dialogue quoted above. Everything is connected and everything affects everything else, but realizing this isn&#8217;t the key to happiness and inner peace, because the connections run through Vauban&#8217;s &#8220;human drama,&#8221; which includes the bad stuff (cruelty, manipulation, betrayal) in addition to warm fuzzy feelings.</p>
<p>The Blanket Theory is visually represented in the movie by a special effect in which little blocks (usually containing eyes or lips or noses) detach from their positions onscreen and float about interconnecting with one another. The blocks usually float in a disorganized jumble&#8212;they represent the inner perceptions of Albert and Tommy, who certainly don&#8217;t perfectly perceive the Blanket. But at the turning point of the movie, the pieces slide into place: Brad Stand is weeping (his house has just burnt down), Caterine Vauban (the arsonist with Albert&#8217;s help) snaps a Polaroid of him and hands it to Albert, who watches the features of his own face detach, float to the photo, and superimpose themselves on Brad&#8217;s face. A moment of pure empathy. Everything is the same&#8212;even if it&#8217;s different. <em>Albert knows how Brad feels</em>. The fact that Albert caused Brad&#8217;s despair by setting fire to his house only tightens this moment of human interconnection.</p>
<div><hr /></div>
<p><a href="index.html#ref-281-1"><sup id="note-281-1">*</sup></a> Any story that takes on existential philosophy and the absurdity of the world must take on the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001&#8212;maybe especially one that uses &#8220;liberal-left despair&#8221; (<a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=288551"><cite class="People">Manohla Dargis</cite>, <cite class="News">New York Times</cite></a>) as its Muse. &#8220;That big September thing&#8221; is the only direct mention of 9/11. The way <cite class="People">Lily Tomlin</cite>, playing Vivian Jaffe, hesitates almost imperceptibly before saying it is at the heart of the lovely subtlety that slips around beneath the movie&#8217;s explosive mania and rewards viewers who pay attention.</p>
<p><a href="index.html#ref-281-2"><sup id="note-281-2">&#8224;</sup></a> Although Rose seems to have an idea that the movie&#8217;s conclusion is deconstructive rather than synthetic, or perhaps both. Or that the entire movie is deconstructive or something. I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll comment and <em>explain herself</em>.

Note that an art component isn????????t a required part of the contest, but if anybody feels like making a cool Scott Pilgrim-related drawing????????a drawing of I don????????t know what, since this is a contest for people who haven????????t read the book, but that????????s part of the challenge, I guess????????then one talented artist will receive the Special Art Appreciation Prize.</li>
