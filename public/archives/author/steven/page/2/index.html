<h3>What I Watched</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0166924/"><cite class="Movies">Mulholland Dr.</cite></a>, <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000186/"><cite class="People">David Lynch</cite></a>:</strong> I only recently discovered Lynch&#8217;s ten clues&#8212;or, actually, I might have seen them before and forgotten about them. Here they are (from <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulholland_Dr.">&#8220;Mulholland Dr.&#8221;</a> on <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay particular attention in the beginning of the film: at least two clues are revealed before the credits.</li>
<li>Notice appearances of the red lampshade.</li>
<li>Can you hear the title of the film that Adam Kesher is auditioning actresses for? Is it mentioned again?</li>
<li>An accident is a terrible event&#8230;notice the location of the accident.</li>
<li>Who gives a key, and why?</li>
<li>Notice the robe, the ashtray, the coffee cup.</li>
<li>What is felt, realized and gathered at the club Silencio?</li>
<li>Did talent alone help Camilla?</li>
<li>Notice the occurrences surrounding the man behind Winkies.</li>
<li>Where is Aunt Ruth?</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&#8217;t take then time to figure out all the clues, but some of them are pretty easy: one of the clues before the credits is the first-person-perspective shot of somebody lying down to sleep; the red lampshade appears first next to the phone that isn&#8217;t answered in the sequence of phone calls between the conspirators against Rita, and later when Diane receives the phone call from Camilla about the party; Adam Kesher is auditioning actresses for <cite>The Sylvia North Story</cite>, which is the film where Diane and Camilla met; Rita&#8217;s accident is at the same place Camilla meets Diane to bring her to the party; etc. The most common interpretation of the movie seems to be that the first part (before the cowboy tells Diane to wake up) is Diane&#8217;s dream after learning that the hit man she hired has killed Camilla, and the second part is Diane&#8217;s descent to insanity mixed with memories or hallucinations of events leading up to her decision to have Camilla killed. Many of Lynch&#8217;s clues do suggest this interpretation, but I but I&#8217;ve never been convinced. The second part seems more believable&#8212;not only because <a href="http://www.ynot.motime.com/1099670390#369550">&#8220;there&#8217;s an overwhelming tendency, amongst critics and other analytical folk, to privilege the &#8217;sordid&#8217; over the &#8217;sentimental&#8217;&#8221;</a> but also because it doesn&#8217;t have strange conspirators controlling everything behind the scenes&#8212;of course, the conspirators are all still there, but they&#8217;re presumably regular folks whom Diane incorporates into her fantasies. But does verisimilitude have any place in a movie like this?</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the man behind Winkies, Silencio, the blue key and the blue box. In <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1110254700#427376">one of the comments threads</a> for one of <cite class="People">David Fiore</cite>&#8217;s many posts on <cite>Mulholland Dr.</cite> at <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/">Motime like the Present</a>, a fellow named Charles points out something about Silencio I hadn&#8217;t known:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Lynch plays on an old joke of his, and one of his most memorable scenes, by doing himself one better: he has del Rio playing herself, lipsyncing to her own song, a Spanish cover of Orbison. This joke loses much of its humor if (1) you fail to recognize the reality of del Rio, an actual person, (2) its connection to the very real oeuvre of Lynch and (3) how its reality might differ from the rest of the film.</p></blockquote>
<p><cite>Mulholland Dr.</cite> is actually the only Lynch movie I&#8217;ve seen, so I can&#8217;t follow the joke (it&#8217;s apparently something to do with <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0090756/"><cite class="Movies">Blue Velvet</cite></a>), but I note that it reinforces the central theme of Silencio. Rebeka del Rio lip-synching to a recording of herself&#8212;it&#8217;s indistinguishable from reality, but it&#8217;s fake. The movie is full of juxtapositions of obvious fakes and perfectly realistic fakes: Betty&#8217;s jokey rehearsal with Rita and her real rehearsal with Jimmy Katz; Adam Kesher&#8217;s unenthusiastic approval of Camilla Rhodes and his &#8220;love at first sight&#8221; moment with Betty; Naomi Watts&#8217;s bubbly Nancy Drew acting in the first part and her almost show-offy naturalistic despair in the second.</p>
<p>Backing up a bit&#8212;the two parts of the movie, the dream and the reality according to the standard interpretation. Like I said, I&#8217;ve never been convinced by the standard interpretation, but I do think there are distinct levels of reality (fictional reality, I mean) at play. The reality narrative seems more real than the dream narrative (insofar as one fiction can be more real than another), if only because it&#8217;s more sensible to extrapolate a fantastic dream from a hallucinatory reality than vice versa. But there are complications&#8212;the theme of obviously fake things and other fake things that look real in comparison, for one. For another, there&#8217;s the reversal of causality: the dream is caused by the reality, but their relationship is obfuscated by the presentation of the dream before the reality. As I watch the movie, I think, &#8220;Diane&#8217;s car ride along Mulholland Dr. is just like Rita&#8217;s&#8221;; it&#8217;s only upon consideration, after the movie, that I see clearly how causality runs backwards through the movie. It&#8217;s Diane who wakes up at the end of the dream, so it&#8217;s presumably Diane who goes to sleep at the very beginning of the movie. But when she wakes up, it&#8217;s like one of those unsettling dreams about waking up from a dream. The reality is more real than the dream, but it&#8217;s nothing like firm ground for us to stand on. But maybe that&#8217;s the best we have.</p>
<p>The dream and the reality are both stories Diane/Betty tells herself; the difference is that she&#8217;s in control of the former (for a while), while the latter crashes messily into other peoples&#8217; stories. Now we&#8217;re going way back in Peiratikos history to <a href="../../../../2004/01/03/prolegomena-to-a-theory-of-why-i-like-stuff/index.html">creation of self through narrative</a>. We create and know ourselves through stories, but the problem with being the authors of our own life stories is that we&#8217;re also characters in other people&#8217;s life stories.</p>
<p>I completely forgot to talk about the man behind Winkies and the blue box. Maybe later, maybe later.

<h3>What I Read</h3>
<div class="img lalign"><a href="https://peiratikos.net/wp/wp-content/images/bananasunday1-4.jpg"><img src="https://peiratikos.net/wp/wp-content/images/thumb-bananasunday1-4.jpg" width="122" height="200" alt="Banana Sunday #1, p. 4" /></a></div>
<p><strong><cite class="Comics">Banana Sunday</cite> #1, by <cite class="People">Root Nibot</cite> and <cite class="People">Colleen Coover</cite>:</strong> Orangutans and gorillas are apes, not monkeys. This error is especially troubling in a book that I would otherwise happily give to a child. Oh well. Nibot writes stylized, emotionally heightened dialogue&#8212;it&#8217;s like the characters are just a little more excited by everything than they would be if the dialogue were more naturalistic. Hmm, I see <a href="http://precur.blogspot.com/"><cite class="People">David Welsh</cite></a> has <a href="http://precur.blogspot.com/2005/07/from-stack-banana-sunday-1.html">already explained</a> what I&#8217;m trying to talk about. As he notes, a lot of the dialogue is exclamatory declarations of character traits. It fits just right with Coover&#8217;s cartoony exaggeration. The page I&#8217;ve scanned here is one of the clearest examples, especially the middle tier of panels. Coover tends to draw characters in an odd half-hunched posture&#8212;it makes them look endearingly eager or beleaguered as appropriate. Go-Go the gorilla is a shameless scene stealer, and I cannot resist.</p>
<p><strong><cite class="Books">Moby-Dick</cite>, by <cite class="People">Herman Melville</cite>:</strong> I&#8217;ve only just started it. I hated <cite class="Books">Billy Budd</cite> when I had to read it in high school, but <cite>Moby-Dick</cite> is great fun so far. So far it&#8217;s mostly been the madcap adventures of Ishmael and Queequeeg, and I can&#8217;t wait till this comedy duo encounters Captain Ahab and his mad quest&#8212;who knows what&#8217;ll happen then, but it&#8217;s sure to be crazy and entertaining. For some reason, I imagine Grant Morrison reading <cite>Moby-Dick</cite> at a malleable age. I&#8217;ll have more to say when I&#8217;ve finished the book, I think.</p>
<p>Rose and I saw <cite>Mulholland Dr.</cite> and <cite>Rize</cite> recently, so hopefully more about them later. And, er, <cite>Minority Report</cite>, which I haven&#8217;t forgotten but have been too lazy to watch.

<p>The comics internet is fucked! And we&#8217;re all part of the problem. Really, you&#8217;re not pushing comics forward. We&#8217;re folks on the internet writing about stuff, and we don&#8217;t matter to anybody but ourselves and the few other people who read us. Just kick back, have fun writing about stuff, and don&#8217;t worry about the forward momentum of the art form.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree that the final sentence of <a href="../../../../2005/07/12/galaxies/index.html">Rose&#8217;s post</a> was ill-advised. A very bad idea. If you read everything Rose has written about this and think she&#8217;s accusing anybody of being misogynist or claiming she knows what anybody was thinking during recruiting for CBG, you need to work on your reading comprehension skills. The only badly behaved people in that comments thread are Alan David Doane, Steven Berg and, to a somewhat lesser extent, Christopher Allen.</p>
<p>You all are protesting way too much. Why is that?</p>
<p>You spend&#8212;let me count&#8212;one and a half years writing about comics, then you make a couple of fairly mild criticisms of Comic Book Galaxy (and one ill-advised final sentence, yes, we all remember that) and you&#8217;re suddenly PART OF THE PROBLEM!!!</p>
<p>You are all very silly and hysterical. So am I. Maybe you should get over it now, <a href="http://houseoftheded.blogspot.com/2005/07/blogging-about-blogging-theres-debate.html">Logan and friends</a>. I myself am getting over it&#8230; now. Now you try.<a href="index.html#note-377-1" id="ref-377-1">*</a></p>
<p>P.S. Rose did bring up race, Logan. Thanks for reading before ranting.</p>
<p>P.P.S. No, really, we don&#8217;t want to write for CBG. So sorry.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="index.html#ref-377-1" id="note-377-1">*</a> Yes, actually, this post is part of our <a href="../../../../2005/07/12/galaxies/index.html#comment-2869">shameful secret &#8220;agenda.&#8221;</a> If I used smilies, I&#8217;d put one of those eye-rolling smilies right here.

<h3>What I Watched</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0053779/"><cite class="Movies">La Dolce vita</cite></a>, <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000019/"><cite class="People">Federico Fellini</cite></a> et al.:</strong> The irony of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0056801/"><cite class="Movies">8 &#189;</cite></a> is that even after Guido&#8217;s revelation that he loves everybody and can&#8217;t live without the people in his life, the movie remains trapped in his fantasy. Guido has successfully alienated everybody, but he imagines that they all forgive him and join him in a circus-like celebration of his new happiness; he imagines that everybody else&#8217;s happiness is congruous with his own. The movie remains claustrophobically solipsistic to the end. <cite>La Dolce vita</cite>, on the other hand, remains outside its protagonist Marcello&#8217;s mind. (Guido is a film director and Marcello is a gossip journalist, but they are almost variations of the same character. Guido is more playful, less seemingly defeated by decadence than Marcello; but who knows how Marcello really thinks of himself? The gauche Marcello at the end of <cite>La Dolce vita</cite> might be how the rest of the world sees Guido.) It turns out the whole doomed culture is solipsist. If Marcello ever has an inspiration like Guido&#8217;s, it remains hidden; we see only the stark reality: a sordid orgy, an encounter with a big dead fish, a moment of failed communication. <cite>La Dolce vita</cite> and <cite>8 &#189;</cite> both begin their finales with characters half-walking and half-dancing onto a beach; I recall that the characters moved left to right in <cite>8 &#189;</cite>, but in <cite>La Dolce vita</cite> they move right to left. (Rose reminds me the girl whom Marcello cannot hear and fails to recognize moves from left to right, which is certainly important.) Basic film technique: because right is good (and because Western written languages read left to right, time progresses in a left-to-right circle on a clock, &#038;c.), movement from left to right suggests progress; although the association of left and badness has largely disappeared, movement from right to left still seems backwards. In <cite>8 &#189;</cite>, of course, the characters move clockwise in a circle&#8212;the progress is as illusory as the fantasy in which it occurs.</p>
<p><cite>La Dolce vita</cite> reminds me of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0325123/"><cite class="Movies">Bright Young Things</cite></a> (which I saw first), and I imagine <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000410/"><cite class="People">Stephen Fry</cite></a> was influenced by Fellini in making his own movie. The oppressive sordidness of the upper-class and its hangers-on and the obsession with celebrity are straight out of <cite class="People">Evelyn Waugh</cite>&#8217;s book&#8212;I suppose Fellini was influenced by Waugh. But Fry&#8217;s swarms of photographers and party scenes mixing sexy young people and batty old aristocrats are straight from Fellini. There an interesting connection I just noticed between <cite class="Books">Vile Bodies</cite>/<cite>Bright Young Things</cite> and <cite>La Dolce vita</cite>, viz. the protagonists are both writers who&#8217;ve written books that are never published (Marcello&#8217;s supposed book is only mentioned, Adam&#8217;s is a finished manuscript but is confiscated as smut by Customs). Both are journalists who write celebrity gossip whose books seem to represent a failed communication of something more important and genuine&#8212;it&#8217;s easy to idealize a book that exists only hypothetically. (Adam&#8217;s book exists more than hypothetically but only to him, never to the viewer.)</p>
<h3>What I Read</h3>
<p><strong><cite class="Books">A Dictionary of Modern English Usage</cite>, <cite class="People">H.W. Fowler</cite>:</strong> An indispensable guide to using English with good taste. Provides ceaseless entertainment to the well-educated and pedantic.  The dictionary was published in 1926, so interested readers can judge the accuracy of Fowler&#8217;s speculations on future developments of usage.</p>
<p><strong><cite class="Comics">Shining Knight</cite> #3, <cite class="People">Grant Morrison</cite>, <cite class="People">Simone Bianchi</cite> et al.:</strong> Lots of exposition, <a href="http://joglikescomics.blogspot.com/2005/07/lost-post_03.html">as <cite class="People">Jog</cite> notes</a>, but it&#8217;s pretty fun. The Seven Soldiers stories all have storytelling and the unresolved dialectic of story and reality&#8212;in <cite>Shining Knight</cite> #3, a certain character&#8217;s relation of the original Arthurian myth becomes even more interesting on a second reading, after her true identity is revealed. Elsewhere, narrative captions comment on the narrative with excerpts from an Arthurian protomyth; at the end of issue #2, in fact, Sir Justin responds directly in dialogue to the narration. Morrison infuses <cite>Shining Knight</cite> with myth but avoids tiresomely literal adherence to the monomyth and overwrought quotation from <cite class="Books">The Apocalypse of John</cite>.</p>
<h3>What I Played</h3>
<p><strong><cite class="Games">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</cite>, <cite class="People">Rockstar Games</cite>:</strong> It&#8217;s by far the largest and most complex of the <cite>Grand Theft Auto</cite> games, but it introduces the new concepts gradually as part of gameplay&#8212;in fact, most of the new concepts seem to be unavailable until the game introduces them, so there&#8217;s little chance of confusion. Each new GTA game invites new controversy; I haven&#8217;t heard of any controversy yet surrounding <cite>San Andreas</cite>, but its portrayal of gang banging in the poorest neighborhoods of a fictionalized Los Angeles is unlikely to get a pass. (In fact, Rose informs me, <a href="http://nytimes.com/2005/07/11/technology/11game.html?partner=USERLAND"><cite>San Andreas</cite> is already in trouble</a>.) I was skeptical of the decision to give the player-character in <cite class="Games">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</cite> a name, personality and voice: too much emphasis on the story, which is superfluous and necessary only to give the gameplay a sensible context. <cite>San Andreas</cite>&#8217;s story has become even more, um, serious (relative only to <cite class="Games">Grand Theft Auto 3</cite>), and player-character Carl Johnson&#8217;s sad backstory (he returns to Los Santos at the beginning of the game because his mother has been murdered) is annoyingly incongruous with the hilariously frenetic gameplay. I haven&#8217;t decided yet if <cite>San Andreas</cite> is too big and too realistic, too focused on character and story, but it&#8217;s been fun for the fifteen or so hours I&#8217;ve played.

<p><strong><cite class="Comics">Young Avengers</cite>, <cite class="People">Allan Heinberg</cite>, <cite class="People">Jim Cheung</cite> et al.</strong></p>
<p>[This began as a post of brief thoughts on books I&#8217;ve read and movies I&#8217;ve watched in the last week (a new column-type thing I hope will get me posting at least once or twice a week), but my piece on <cite>Young Avengers</cite> #4 &#038; #5 ended up so long that I decided I&#8217;d better put it in its own post.]</p>
<p>I almost wrote a response to James Meeley&#8217;s latest correspondence, but why bother? I will note that Heinberg diplomatically explains to him that <cite>Young Avengers</cite> is not an all-ages book. (Meeley, one imagines, objects also to teenagers reading about sex.) It is an intelligent book about and for teenagers. The art is pleasant; Cheung draws reasonably anatomically correct figures and costumes that look like real (albeit exceedingly tight) clothes. The story is pregnant with identity crisis both fantastic and realistic&#8212;the fuel of a good superhero story in <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/"><cite class="People">David Fiore</cite>&#8217;s</a> neo-existentialist romance mold, I think. The typical secret-identity confusion (and these kids&#8217; secret identities are multilayered) is enhanced by the liminality of adolescence.<a href="index.html#exp-372-1" id="expref-372-1">*</a> Iron Lad of the 30th century (ha ha) knows he&#8217;s going to grow up to be Kang the Conqueror (apparently a particularly infamous supervillain)&#8212;unless he refuses to do so, a decision which would irrevocably change not only his own 30th-century future but, thanks to Kang&#8217;s time traveling, the future of the 20th century, causing who knows what temporal chaos. Patriot is the grandson of Isiah Bradley, the black Captain America. Cassie Lang, Ant-Man&#8217;s daughter, thought she was normal, but it turns out she has superpowers too. Kate Bishop has no superpowers and isn&#8217;t even related to any superheroes, but she&#8217;s turning into one of those Batman-type characters who outdoes the superpowered but inexperienced&#8212;and, it must be said, inept&#8212;guys with pure human skill and cool-headedness. We don&#8217;t know much about Hulkling and the Asgardian yet.</p>
<p>Patriot (who, if he&#8217;s the kid from the end of <cite class="Comics">Truth: Red, White &#038; Black</cite>, is named Litigious) and Kate are the most interesting characters so far, I think. Patriot is a kid with a chip on his shoulder about Captain America&#8217;s role, however unknowing, in Isiah Bradley&#8217;s ruin, who finds himself with a power and responsibility he doesn&#8217;t want because of his heritage and who tries to compensate for his basic immaturity with a dubious attempt at macho bravado. Kate, on the other hand, is a girl who saves the day when the Young Avengers botch an attempt to rescue two hundred wedding guests in a church from hostage-takers; she decides to tag along with Cassie when Cassie goes on a search for the Young Avengers, and she grabs some superhero weapons and leaps into battle when Kang the Conqueror attacks. Their relationship begins with typical &#8220;no girls allowed on our superteam&#8221; posturing by Patriot, but it veers off in entertaining directions all its own when his attacks whither against Kate&#8217;s unassailable confidence. That their mundane adolescent sparring plays out in the midst of superhero battles heightens rather than diminishes the human drama. <a href="../../../../2005/06/16/dreaming/index.html">As Rose says (of <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite>)</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://peiratikos.net/archives/2005/06/16/dreaming/"><p>The reason I like superhero stories is because they have so little to do with the smashing and stomping that are supposed to be at their core, at least if done correctly. Instead they&#8217;re a heavy template for readers to fit themselves into a reality where certain narratives make sense and the readers can make sense of themselves. It&#8217;s not about the power fantasy but about both power and fantasy, which is something over-specific &#8220;slice of life&#8221; stories can miss.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pretty much all the stories I&#8217;ve encountered in my life that I really enjoyed (as well as many that I didn&#8217;t enjoy) have at least a little bit of magic to undermine the alienating specificity of realism.<a href="index.html#exp-372-2" id="expref-372-2">&#8224;</a> Kate and Patriot are very good. Iron Lad worries me, though, because Kang the Conqueror threatens constantly to overwhelm the story and turn it into a dumb fight between the Avengers and Kang. Battles and backstory minutiae don&#8217;t interest me in themselves, and they quickly bore me when they become detached from more entertaining storytelling concerns. That&#8217;s always the danger with a mainstream superhero story, that it turns into series of fight scenes and explorations of minor points of backstory, with the moral or philosophical problems of the story typically degenerating into inchoate muttering about heroism. An most infamous recent example is <cite>Identity Crisis</cite>, a story whose only reasons for existence are to explain apparent inconsistencies in some supervillains&#8217; characterization and to engage in hand-wringing over superheroes&#8217; inability to protect their loved ones (due mostly to ineptitude and negligence, as far as I can tell). The latter might have made for a good story,<a href="index.html#exp-372-3" id="expref-372-3">&#8225;</a> but nothing ever comes of it except faux-tough-guy narration from Green Arrow about the tragedy of your wife getting killed because you&#8217;re never home and you forgot to secure your house against tiny people crawling through the phone lines.<a href="index.html#exp-372-4" id="expref-372-4">**</a> So I worry that <cite>Young Avengers</cite> will degenerate into a big fight, with Iron Lad doing the right thing because he&#8217;s a hero (or doing the wrong thing because he&#8217;s destined to become a villain). Issue #5 remains entertaining, but it&#8217;s walking the fine line between a story with fighting and a story about the fighting. But I&#8217;m not very worried, because the last page (which genuinely surprised me) all but guarantees an entertaining conclusion for Iron Lad. Still, I never underestimate the corrupting influence of Marvel.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="index.html#expref-372-1" id="exp-372-1">*</a> A note on adolescent power fantasy and the mainstream of superhero comic books. To suggest that superhero stories are immature power fantasies is to commit careless synechdoche in considering genuinely (if not self-consciously) immature power fantasies as the totality of the genre in ignorance (sometimes real, sometimes feigned) of more sophisticated stories about <a href="../../../../2005/06/16/dreaming/index.html">power and fantasy</a> and identity. (Moreover, they tend to ignore the potentially interesting parts of otherwise banal or objectionable stories, such as the metafictional weirdness of <cite class="Comics">Crisis on Infinite Earths</cite>.) In truth, superhero stories are a subset of a larger genre of fantastic fiction that includes, in addition to obvious superhero stories: <cite class="Comics">Scott Pilgrim</cite>; much of <cite class="People">Grant Morrison</cite>&#8217;s work in comics, especially <cite class="Comics">The Invisibles</cite> but also <cite class="Comics">Kill Your Boyfriend</cite> and <cite class="Comics">Sebastian O</cite>; <cite class="Comics">Eightball</cite> #23 (&#8221;The Death-Ray&#8221;); <cite class="Books">Dune</cite>; <cite class="Movies">Wings of Desire</cite>; <cite class="Television">Joan of Arcadia</cite>. Perhaps I shouldn&#8217;t call it a genre; it&#8217;s not a coherent body of works like, say, film noir. It&#8217;s a disparate collection of fantastic stories with potentially interesting thematic relations. Occasionally there is clear intertexuality, but the mainstream of superhero comics is largely insular and doesn&#8217;t invite comparison with anything outside. Those few superhero comics which escape the stultifying effect of that insularity may be more fruitfully considered, I now think, in the larger context than in the context of the superhero mainstream.</p>
<p>There are several common elements in these stories, viz.: confusion and ambiguity about identity, represented in the protagonist both by a fantastic secret or unknown identity and by more realistic identity crises; a problematic power relationship enhanced by the protagonist&#8217;s preternatural abilities; significant romantic and existentialist influence; stories about stories (e.g., flashbacks, frame stories, storyteller characters); rejection of naturalism in favor of artificiality, often through narratorial and authorial discussion of the story (instead of remaining unobtrusive to assist &#8216;willing suspension of disbelief&#8217;) and extensive use of allusion and intertexuality.</p>
<p><a href="index.html#expref-372-2" id="exp-372-2">&#8224;</a> This is a problematic statement, probably too much so. I should distinguish between, um, storytelling and journalism. No, I don&#8217;t like those terms, but I mean narratives that are about more than their specific events and narratives that are about only their specific events. When I write <i>story</i>, I mean the former class of narrative. The latter kind is not a lesser art; the only lesser art is an attempt to create the former class of narrative using only the tools of the latter.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the nature of the magic used in service of <i>stories</i> has a profound effect. The superpowers and secret identities in <cite>Young Avengers</cite> encourage one kind of story, and the ubiquitous blue tv glow and mysterious guy who paints &#8220;Ghost World&#8221; graffiti in <cite class="Comics">Ghost World</cite> encourage an entirely different kind. Obviously, I don&#8217;t consider &#8216;magic&#8217; necessarily to be actual magic; I consider &#8216;magic&#8217; to encompass any non-realistic storytelling device. I shan&#8217;t presume to guess how other people read, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if even the strictest adherent of realism could find the realism-undermining magic in a beloved story or, failing that, recognize that the &#8217;story&#8217; in fact belongs to the second class of narrative mentioned above.</p>
<p><a href="index.html#expref-372-3" id="exp-372-3">&#8225;</a> E.g., Grant Morrison&#8217;s <cite class="Comics">Animal Man</cite>.</p>
<p><a href="index.html#expref-372-4" id="exp-372-4">**</a> Not all such stories are bad&#8212;1960s DC comic books abound with five-page stories explaining how Superman used to hang out with Jay Garrick even though Jay Garrick is a fictional comic-book character in 1960s continuity (there&#8217;s a second Earth with Jay Garrick and a second Superman, which emits psychic radiation or something into the minds of comic-book writers) and why nobody realizes Clark Kent is Superman (Superman unwittingly transmits hypnotic disguise rays to people around him). Plenty of comic-book readers love stuff, obviously, so good for them. <cite>Identity Crisis</cite>&#8217;s crime is taking up seven long issues and being aesthetically offensive and dumb.

<hr /><br />
<blockquote><p>[&#8230;] Anderton said: &#8220;You&#8217;ve probably grasped the basic legalistic drawback to precrime methodology. We&#8217;re taking in individuals who have broken no law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they surely will,&#8221; Witwer affirmed with conviction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Happily they <i>don&#8217;t</i>&#8212;because we get them first, before they can commit an act of violence. So the commission of the crime itself is absolute metaphysics. We claim they&#8217;re culpable. They, on the other hand, eternally claim they&#8217;re innocent. And, in a sense, they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lift let them out, and they again paced down a yellow corridor. &#8220;In our society we have no major crimes,&#8221; Anderton went on, &#8220;but we do have a detention camp full of would-be criminals. (228-229)</p></blockquote>
<p>In &#8220;Minority Report,&#8221; John Anderton is the founder and chief of Precrime. He acknowledges the apparent dilemma of precrime, but he doesn&#8217;t consider it a dilemma: it&#8217;s not a problem to imprison people who would have been considered innocent under the old &#8220;post-crime&#8221; legal system (obviously, since they haven&#8217;t actually committed a crime), because they certainly would have committed a crime if given the chance. It&#8217;s an odd metaphysics: The people who <em>will</em> commit a crime have no free will; their future is determined. But for the police who know the future, it remains undetermined; they can prevent a crime they know will be committed. It&#8217;s unclear what happens to precriminals; they may be imprisoned only until the time of their alleged crime is past or they may be imprisoned indefinitely. But either way, the system is problematic, at least from a human-rights perspective: if the police can change the future, then the future must be indeterminate; and it seems&#8212;to me, anyway&#8212;that we could <em>reasonably doubt</em> the rectitude of a conviction for a potential crime, however likely. But Anderton has absolute faith in the system, until the prediction of his own commission of murder comes in:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You have to be taken in&#8212;if Precrime is to survive. You&#8217;re thinking of your own safety. But think, for a moment, about the system. [&#8230;] Which means more to you&#8212;your own personal safety or the existence of the system?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My safety,&#8221; Anderton answered, without hesitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re positive?&#8221;</p>
<p>[&#8230;] &#8220;If the system can survive only by imprisoning innocent people, then it deserves to be destroyed. My personal safety is important because I&#8217;m a human being.&#8221; (250)</p></blockquote>
<p>He has apparently be framed&#8212;by his new assistant Witwer, he first thinks, but it turns about to be the Army&#8212;for the future murder of retire general Leopold Kaplan, except it turns out he wasn&#8217;t framed: the prediction is accurate. But he nows he won&#8217;t kill Kaplan&#8212;he was going to kill Kaplan the Army manipulated events so that he would, and after he discovers this plot he suddenly has no reason to commit murder. As it turns out, though, that was the Army&#8217;s plan all along: get a murder prediction for Anderton, let him discover their plot to prevent him from actually committing the murder, then discredit Precrime by revealing the clearly inaccurate prediction. Their goal is to get Precrime shut down so they can step in and take control of the police state.</p>
<p>Actually, one of the precog mutants (there are three) is slightly out of phase with the other two, like a clock running slow; and he, with Anderton&#8217;s knowledge of his own future as part of his predictive data set, predicts that Anderton will <em>not</em> commit murder. This minority report, as it&#8217;s called, doesn&#8217;t help Precrime much, as the Army plans to present it as proof that Anderton wouldn&#8217;t have committed murder. When a minority report occurs, it&#8217;s assumed that the majority report is accurate, so the Army can point out that in Anderton&#8217;s case, the minority report is in fact the accurate prediction.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more important: his own life, or the system he created? Will he sacrifice the system he created to save himself? He sure will&#8212;until he discovers the Army&#8217;s goal of usurping Precrime&#8217;s position, at which point he quickly and silently changes his mind. After reviewing the three precog reports, he discovers that there are in fact <em>three</em> out-of-phase minority reports: the first predicts he will murder Kaplan, the second predicts he will change his mind and not murder Kaplan, the third predicts he will change his mind again and murder Kaplan after all. The third prediction provides him an opportunity to foil the Army&#8217;s plan: he must murder Kaplan to demonstrate the system&#8217;s accuracy. Will he sacrifice himself to save the system he created? He will. But only a few minutes before he finally decides to kill Kaplan, he was convinced of the system&#8217;s inhumanity and injustice. How does he justify his change of heart? He cheats. When Witwer worries about the serious flaw in the system implied by Anderton&#8217;s surprising sequence of predictions, Anderton says, &#8220;It can only happen in one circumstance [&#8230;] My case was unique, since I had access to the data&#8221; (264). It&#8217;s a weak argument. It&#8217;s true that the precogs turned out to be correct in Anderton&#8217;s case; but as he says, his case is unique: that the precogs would happen to make three <em>different</em> predictions such that the predictions demonstrate that the future is determinate rather than indeterminate is wildly implausible, and Anderton is unbelievably lucky it happened to him. Much more likely, in a case like Anderton&#8217;s, the precogs would end up with an inaccurate prediction. Anderton insists that you can change your future only if you know what it&#8217;s supposed to be, but that&#8217;s metaphysical theorizing, and there&#8217;s no apparent reason to believe it. The predictions of Anderton&#8217;s commission of murder are accurate (in a bizarre way), but their more important implication is that the future is indeterminate, that a prediction doesn&#8217;t indicate something that will certainly happen unless the police prevent it. That much was obvious to us readers from the beginning, of course, and Anderton&#8217;s ordeal makes the problem painfully clear. But, for Anderton, political necessity trumps personal safety <em>and</em> human rights.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually not completely sure what I want to say about <cite>Minority Report</cite> yet, so I&#8217;ll end here for now.

<p>This is an important message for comics bloggers who think they&#8217;re doing podcasting. <em>You know who you are</em>.</p>
<p>Read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting">&#8220;Podcasting&#8221;</a> from <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>. Pay especial attention to the first two paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting"><p>Podcasting is a method of publishing sound files to the Internet, allowing users to subscribe to a feed and receive new audio files automatically. Podcasting is distinct from other types of audio content delivery because it uses the RSS 2.0 file format. This technique has enabled many producers to create self-published, syndicated radio shows.</p>
<p>Users subscribe to podcasts using &#8220;podcatching&#8221; software (also called &#8220;aggregator&#8221; software) which periodically checks for and downloads new content</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works: You, the podcaster, have a web site with some audio files (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3">MP3s</a>) and an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Really_Simple_Syndication">RSS 2.0</a> feed that attaches those audio files to it using an RSS feature called <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/enclosuresAggregators">&#8220;enclosures.&#8221;</a> If this is too advanced for you, just think of the RSS feed as a list of audio files that a computer program can read, because that&#8217;s pretty much what it is. Somebody who wants to listen to your podcasts subscribes to your podcast feed with &#8220;podcatching&#8221; software, like <a href="http://ipodder.org/">iPodder</a>. iPodder checks the feed occasionally and downloads new files it finds on the list. You might wonder this publishing method is called <i>podcasting</i>: it&#8217;s named after the iPod, which you can use to listen to the files. You can also, of course, use another kind of digital-audio player or even listen to the files on your computer.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the important part: <strong>If you upload MP3s to your web site and link directly to them on your blog, <em>you are not podcasting.</em></strong> (Unless you use <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, which is so clever that it automatically turns your RSS 2.0 feed into a podcast when you link to an audio file in a post.)</p>
<p>Inform yourself! Learn what podcasting is <em>before</em> you hop on the bandwagon&#8212;unless you <em>want</em> people to think you&#8217;re ignorant and misinformed.

<p>Film adaptations of <cite class="People">Philip K. Dick</cite>&#8217;s stories are obviously nothing like the stories. But I&#8217;ve never thought in depth about specifically how they differ, so now I&#8217;m looking at Dick&#8217;s &#8220;Minority Report&#8221; vs. <cite class="People">Steven Spielberg</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Movies">Minority Report</cite>.</p>
<p>First, most immediately obvious, is style. Here&#8217;s a passage from &#8220;Minority Report&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Jerry&#8221; was twenty-four years old. Originally, he had been classified as a hydrocephalic idiot but when he reached the age of six the psych testers had identified the precog talent, buried under the layers of tissue corrosion. Placed in a government-operated training school, the latent talent had been cultivated. By the time he was nine the talent had advanced to a useful stage. &#8220;Jerry,&#8221; however, remained in the aimless chaos of idiocy; the burgeoning faculty had absorbed the totality of his personality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Serviceable but unpolished. It&#8217;s a little clunky; the third sentence is carelessly ungrammatical. Having read several of Dick&#8217;s novels and short stories, I suspect he would write a story once, as quickly as he could, and never look back. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s really the case; but he wrote forty-four novels and one-hundred twenty-one short stories in about thirty years, so he couldn&#8217;t have had much time for revision and proofreading. Dick&#8217;s writing isn&#8217;t always as rough as that passage, and it has its own shabby charm; but mostly, you don&#8217;t Dick to admire his lovely prose style. He rushes too urgently through the story to have style.</p>
<p>The story also lacks for description, both of the future world and the immediate environments and characters. Anything that must be described receives minimal description. The story takes place in New York, under the control of the Federal Westbloc Government; &#8220;Federal&#8221; suggests some continuity with the United States of America, and &#8220;Westbloc&#8221; suggests the government is a descendent of NATO. There was a devestating Anglo-Chinese War which left much of at least North America in blasted ruins, during which the Westbloc was controlled entirely by the military, which operated a domestic police force in addition to fighting the war. After the war, the Westbloc was demilitarized and the Precrime Agency founded to run the police force. There is a Senate, but it&#8217;s not clear what it does or what the government looks like at all. The preceeding paragraph is not a summary: it is almost the entirety of the setting information provided by the story itself. There are a few other details, but none of them implies a deeper world than is explicitly presented.</p>
<p>But consider <cite>Minority Report</cite>. Like all film adaptations of Dick&#8217;s work, the first thing you notice is how <em>good</em> it looks. Not only good, but polished and shiny; the entire movie has a hazy, slightly overexposed glow. It looks like the inside of a tv ad. True, it&#8217;s not all shiny and tv-ready: Spielberg&#8217;s vision of Dick&#8217;s paranoid future does have slums populated by illicit Russian surgeons and drug dealers who&#8217;ve removed their own eyes to avoid ubiquitous retinal scanners. But the prettiness seeps even into the slum, in the form of a huge tv screen running ads for the precog police unit attached to the bottom of an overpass. (I&#8217;m not sure whether the slum advertising is supposed to be frightening or comforting, but it doesn&#8217;t matter in the end; the slum is forgotten in the climactic confrontation between the powerful.)</p>
<p>Where Dick&#8217;s story lacks style, Spielberg&#8217;s movie is intensely stylized; and where Dick&#8217;s world is sparse, Spielberg&#8217;s is dense. That density is necessary for Spielberg&#8217;s Hollywood brand of realism. It&#8217;s part of Spielberg&#8217;s schtick: he goes to great lengths to present a plausible future reality. (Of course, plausibility always comes second to thrilling chase scenes.) According to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&#038;node=&#038;contentId=A20469-2002Jun20"><cite class="People">Joel Garreau</cite>&#8217;s account</a> of Spielberg&#8217;s <cite>Minority Report</cite> futurist think tank, producer <cite class="People">Bonnie Curtis</cite> claimed that the movie is grounded in &#8220;future reality&#8221; rather than &#8220;science fiction.&#8221; I know Spielberg said something similar about <cite class="Movies">Jurassic Park</cite> back in 1993&#8212;I believe he used the phrase &#8220;science future&#8221;&#8212;but unfortunately I don&#8217;t have a citation for that. In his piece, Garreau says that</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;the moviemakers seem to have gone to great deal of trouble to make this a legally persuasive future. The tension throughout the movie is between safety and freedom, a timely topic in 2002. And the whole plot of the movie centers on the notion that this Pre-Cog system is utterly infallible. Only thus can it be seen as reasonable search and seizure. Philip K. Dick didn&#8217;t go to this much trouble in his 1956 story of the same name on which the film is based.</p></blockquote>
<p>These statements not only demonstrate a profound ignorance of science fiction outside the sealed-off reality of Hollywood; they also suggest how and why the filmmakers fail to understand or choose to ignore Dick&#8217;s point. For Dick, the point is not specifically how the Constitution would have to change to allow the existence of a precrime police agency in the United States; the point is to discover the more fundamental change required in society, the moral implications of that change and the impossibility of unchanging it. Details of world-building are unimportant, so Dick leaves them out. For Spielberg, though, the spectacle of an amazing future (and amazing chase scenes!) is at least as important as the moral implications of that future, if not moreso. Spielberg love big shiny toys&#8212;in fact, most filmmakers in Hollywood making science-fiction movies love big shiny toys.  Despite Bonnie Curtis&#8217;s misguided praise, <cite>Minority Report</cite> is not fundamentally much different from, say, <cite>The Matrix</cite>: both movies surround a potentially daring speculative concept with dazzling Hollwood spectacle. (Actually, <cite>The Matrix</cite> is an unusually clever example of Hollywood science fiction: it turns its dazzling spectacle into something weightier by presenting a speculation about the relationship between reality and spectacle.) Spielberg likes to hire experts for a sense of authoritative realism, but that&#8217;s only another part of the spectacle.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for Part 2: John Anderton vs. John Anderton.

<p><a href="http://www.observer.com/pages/frontpage4.asp"><cite class="People">Ron Rosenbaum</cite></a> is going to upset some people. In fact, <a href="http://www.alltooflat.com/about/personal/sean/?BlogNum=943">he already has</a>. The bulk of Sean&#8217;s reply to Rosenbaum focuses on Rosenbaum&#8217;s perceived anti-white-male prejudice, and <a href="http://foragerblog.blogspot.com/2005/05/anti-white-bias-of-kill-bills-critics.html"><cite class="People">Jon Hastings</cite> has already pointed out the flaws</a> in Sean&#8217;s invocation of race. And <a href="http://www.alltooflat.com/about/personal/sean/?BlogNum=945">Sean has acknowledged the flaws</a> and further claimed that his argument is really mostly against Rosenbaum&#8217;s &#8220;anti-male, anti-fanboy&#8221; prejudice. Which, first of all, being anti-fanboy isn&#8217;t the same thing at all as being anti-male, so let&#8217;s not obfuscate things. And as for being anti-fanboy&#8212;Rosenbaum is that, indeed. Is Rosenbaum talking crazy talk?</p>
<p>Now, most of you reading this blog probably have had some exposure to geek subculture; I&#8217;m sure you know what a fanboy is. And you know that there are&#8212;um, <em>girl</em> fanboys too, which is a problem for the gender-specificity of the term. Or is it? In the egalitarian twenty-first century, we can <em>all</em> be nerdy ????ber-fans, but who dominates? From where I&#8217;m looking, it&#8217;s guys, guys, guys. Sean specifically cites <cite class="People">Elizabeth Avellan</cite> as a producer of <cite class="Movies">Sin City</cite>&#8212;one of eight, and producers don&#8217;t really have creative input in modern filmmaking anyway. He also cites <cite class="People">Uma Thurman</cite>&#8217;s collaboration with <cite class="People">Quentin Tarantino</cite> on <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill</cite>, which I don&#8217;t know much about. But that some women have creative roles in these movies doesn&#8217;t have a lot of weight against Rosenbaum&#8217;s argument, especially because, N.B., how many women <em>direct</em> these fanboy movies? (By the way, Jon makes the good point that <cite>Sin City</cite> is not referential in the same way <cite>Kill Bill</cite> is, but I think that&#8217;s only a minor flaw in Rosenbaum&#8217;s argument. Rosenbaum also mentions <cite class="Movies">Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow</cite>, and I&#8217;m inclined to think these movies use different means to reach similar ends.) I don&#8217;t know of any. Are there any? But even if there are, let&#8217;s face it, the dominant creative source, and the dominant audience destination, of fanboy movies is guys. They&#8217;re called fanboys for a reason, after all&#8212;it&#8217;s silly to claim women <em>aren&#8217;t</em> involved in this stuff (not that Rosenbaum actually claimed any such thing, that I see), but it&#8217;s equally silly to claim that the stereotypical association of fanboy stuff&#8212;manly violence, phallic symbols (swords!), pseudo-feminist &#8220;tough-guy women&#8221; characters, &#038;c.&#8212;with <em>guys</em> is <em>entirely false</em>.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen <cite>Sin City</cite> and I&#8217;m not sure I will, so I don&#8217;t really know about that. But <cite>Kill Bill</cite> is, in its every aspect, fanboyism turned into an aesthetic. Deep morality? Oh ho. Maybe more on this later, or maybe you all have figured out what I think of <cite>Kill Bill</cite> by now, since I&#8217;ve written about it so much. For now, I might as well link back to <a href="../../../../2005/01/10/remix/index.html">&#8220;Remix Aesthetic in <cite class="Movies">Moulin Rouge</cite> and <cite>Kill Bill</cite>.&#8221; </a> Also, consider: a movie which portentously bleeps out the main character&#8217;s name, solely to set up two of the dumbest name-based puns in history, is the very definition of <em>deliberately</em> pretentiously stupid.
