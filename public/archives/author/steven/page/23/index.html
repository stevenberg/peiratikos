I think I don&#8217;t like the term &#8220;deconstructionism.&#8221; I think deconstruction is a fine critical strategy, but I don&#8217;t see that it needs to be elevated to an ism. I mean, it&#8217;s <ins datetime="2004-01-08T00:33:00 +00:00">a</ins> pretty basic and obvious (to me, anyway) concept&#8212;meaning is unstable, hierarchies and oppositions in texts are unstable and deconstruct themselves. Actually deconstruction doesn&#8217;t destroy stability of meaning, it shifts the site of meaning creation from the text to the reader. Well, meaning is not so concrete&#8230; meaning is not objective. Shall we say it is subjective? I say no. After all, there isn&#8217;t one Reader of a text, but many, readers who analyze and critique and discuss. Stanley Fish&#8217;s idea of interpretive communities. Meaning is a social construct. That is a central concept of postmodernism as I think of it.</p>
<p>Which is not to say I think there&#8217;s any problem with Mr. Baugh&#8217;s blog post. That&#8217;s a great little essay, I hope he writes much more.

<p><a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> is the best web-publishing platform I&#8217;ve encountered (certainly tons better than <a href="http://new.blogger.com">Blogger</a>, although Blogger has the advantage of free hosting on blogspot.com). Full compliance with Web standards (so the developers claim, and I believe them), <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/">TrackBack</a>, <a href="http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback-1.0">Pingback</a>, no page rebuilds, pretty typography, smart text formatting, etc., etc. and so forth.</p>
<p>WordPress is open source freeware, but you do need your own web server to host it on. We&#8217;re paying $80 a year to use WordPress rather than Blogger or something, and it&#8217;s more than worth it.

<div class="text">
<p><em>Sources used in this post:</em> Borges, Jorge Luis. <cite>Collected Fictions</cite>. New York: Viking, 1998.</p>
<p>How common is the idea that the X-Men are a racism/race-relations metaphor? Because I notice people seem to say it a lot (e.g. <a href="http://www.thefourthrail.com/reviews/critiques/010504/uncannyxmen437.shtml">here</a>), and why do people say it so much? I don&#8217;t see it. OK, I see it, but it seems limiting to suppose the X-Men are merely a racial allegory. There&#8217;s the gay metaphor too. But there&#8217;s more. The most common criticism of the racism and gay metaphors I see is that gay people and Hispanics don&#8217;t have superpowers. Oh, but it&#8217;s a metaphor! It&#8217;s something inside that&#8217;s so powerful, so liberating but also uncontrollable, and once you let it out there&#8217;s no going back. It&#8217;s pride, black pride, gay pride, whatever. The X-Men are a fantasy of political activism. When you&#8217;ve been silenced and made invisible for whatever reason, and then you decide to take pride in whatever makes you an invisible and you stand up and make people notice you and your pride, people will, yes, hate and fear you. That&#8217;s what the X-Men are about. I don&#8217;t see any need to make it about any one kind of pride/activism.</p>
<p>Does this have anything to do with my analysis of <cite class="Comics">New X-Men</cite> in terms of &#8220;creation of self through narrative?&#8221; I think it may. If you&#8217;ve read any stories by <cite class="People">Jorge Luis Borges</cite> or the novel <a href="http://www.vurt-feather.co.uk/"><cite class="Books">Vurt</cite></a> by <cite class="People">Jeff Noon</cite> (I&#8217;m not quite changing the subject here), you&#8217;ll probably know what I&#8217;m talking about when I say both these authors (and many other authors, but I&#8217;m using these two as an example) write fantastic narratives in which the world is a text. I mean, there is no illusion (or the illusion is exploded) that the world of the stories is &#8220;real&#8221;&#8212;the world of, say, &#8220;Tl&ouml;n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&#8221; is no more real than an encyclopedia, and in fact it ends up being superseded by a fantasy world described in a fictional encyclopedia article. (I have some essays on Borges&#8217;s and Noon&#8217;s work that go into more depth, I should put them on the blog at some point.) Noon especially writes a protagonist who is empowered by the realization that his world is a textual world.</p>
<p>Borges&#8217;s stories aren&#8217;t just clever but inconsequential metafictional games. They propose a way of looking at our own world:</p>
<blockquote cite="Borges, p. 81"><p>
Then years ago, any symmetry, any system with an appearance of order &#8211; dialectical materialism, anti-Semitism, Nazism &#8211; could spellbind and hypnotize mankind. How could the world not fall under the sway of Tl&ouml;n, how could it not yield to the vast and minutely detailed evidence of an ordered planet? It would be futile to reply that reality is also orderly. Perhaps it is, but orderly in accordance with divine laws (read: &#8220;inhuman laws&#8221;) that we can never quite manage to penetrate. Tl&ouml;n may well be a labyrinth, but it is a labyrinth forged by men, a labyrinth destined to be deciphered by men.

<p>(There are some <cite class="Comics">New X-Men</cite> spoilers lurking in here.)</p>
<p>This is the beginnings of what I think will become an actual essay, with footnotes and everything. I am intrigued by <a href="http://grantmorrison.com/"><cite class="People">Grant Morrison</cite>&#8217;s</a> <cite>New X-Men</cite>, but I&#8217;ve not seen a lot of discussion on the Internet about the things that intrigue me (maybe I&#8217;m looking in the wrong places). What intrigues me is analyzing <cite>New X-Men</cite> in terms of Rose&#8217;s theories about narrative art, specifically <a href="https://peiratikos.net/archive/2004/1/3/prolegomena-to-a-theory-of-why-i-like-stuff/">creation of self through narrative</a>. We&#8217;ve been talking about this a lot lately, and I noted that many (all?) the example narratives we came up with to talk about have as a central conflict the problem of who controls the narrative. I haven&#8217;t seen <cite class="Movies">Capturing the Friedmans</cite> (which Rose talks about in that post I just linked to), but I gather that control (and ownership) of the narratives of people&#8217;s lives is at stake in that story. <cite class="Movies">Paycheck</cite> (which Rose also discusses) is hardly about anything coherent, but it&#8217;s based on a <cite class="People">Philip K. Dick</cite> story (Dick&#8217;s stories are incoherent in a much more interesting way than <cite>Paycheck</cite> the movie), and Dick was always writing about characters losing control of their narratives.</p>
<p>Right, I think <cite>New X-Men</cite> is about characters attempting to create themselves by creating narratives, and it&#8217;s about characters losing control of those narratives. Charles Xavier loses control of his political dream to his evil twin. Henry McCoy tells his ex-girlfriend a little lie and tries somewhat unsuccessfully to turn it to his advantage when it spirals out of control. Emma Frost convinces herself she&#8217;s a good teacher, a good lover, a nurturer, a strong independent person, only to see her life shatter around her. Quentin Quire, after his life is turned topsy-turvy by the revelation that he&#8217;s adopted, constructs a new life for himself out of every possible troubled-teen warning sign and teen-movie cliche (using drugs, bullying, getting in fights, rebelling against authority, turning to radical politics, trying to impress a girl, and much much more) but can&#8217;t control his own inventions. Scott Summers is deeply unhappy with his own (non-)personality but can&#8217;t manage to do anything but stand still as his life goes to hell. Weapon XV bursts through the dome of the World, transcending what was the whole of its existence, only to bindly acquiesce to the controlling forces he finds beyond. (If there are forces beyond comprehension (a military science team running the World, an omniscient god, anthropological determinism, the writer) that know the narrative better than we, can we have any control?) Wolverine gives up control of his own narrative&#8212;decides he&#8217;s the killing machine Weapon Plus says he is and can&#8217;t be more or other than that. So there are all these stories about loss of control and it&#8217;s not just control of power, but control of choice, of selfhood, of the right to be the narrative subject. Loss of control over the narrative of their lives.</p>
<p>There are several things I&#8217;ll be thinking and writing about, in addition to setting out arguments to support my thesis:</p>
<ul>
<li>X-books may be read as very political. What are the politics of <cite>New X-Men</cite>, what do they have to do with creation of self through narrative (or failure to create self through loss of control of the narrative)?</li>
<li><cite>New X-Men</cite> seems optimistic and hopeful (particularly in terms of the X-Men making progress in their political goals), and a lot of people seem to respond strongly and primarily to this in their readings. What&#8217;s the relationship between the surface political optimism and the darker themes of loss of control?</li>
<li>The aesthetics, particularly of the art. What does the sequential-art form do for the text in terms of the narrative themes?</li>
</ul>
