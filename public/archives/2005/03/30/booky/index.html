<div class="text">
<p>Yes, I&#8217;ve been gone for a million years. No, I don&#8217;t have a good excuse. For those who had behind-the-scenes information, <cite class="People">Steven</cite>&#8217;s wisdom teeth came out successfully with only minor weird snags. I&#8217;ve got ideas for several posts I&#8217;d like to make, but first I have to play along because <a href="http://lyle.typepad.com/blog/"><cite class="People">Lyle Masaki</cite></a> hit me with the <a href="http://lyle.typepad.com/blog/2005/03/books_books_boo.html">little book meme</a>, although I&#8217;m considering doing the <a href="http://lyle.typepad.com/blog/2005/03/books_wonderful.html">big book meme</a> too, although with a certain amount of commentary to make it a little more worthwhile and to disobey the rules.</p>
<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s the best I can do bookwise:</p>
<p><strong>You&#8217;re stuck inside <cite clas="Books">Fahrenheit 451</cite>, which book do you want to be?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://brillbuilding.blogspot.com/"><cite class="People">Ian Brill</cite></a> said that <a href="http://brillbuilding.blogspot.com/2005/03/i-meme-mine.html">he wouldn&#8217;t want to have to recite all of <cite class="Books">Infinite Jest</cite></a>, which has convinced me I would. It would be so much fun to figure out how to deal with all the footnotes and footnotes to footnotes that I&#8217;d never have to recite it the same way twice. </p>
<p>When I was a tiny kid and had a better memory than I do now, I could recite full pages of several of the <cite>Narnia</cite> books, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d want to keep with me for all time. I&#8217;m not sure <cite class="People">David Foster Wallace</cite> is either, but I&#8217;m hoping that if I ever get stuck inside <cite>Fahrenheit 451</cite> it&#8217;s a pretty safe bet that this post won&#8217;t be considered legally binding.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever had a crush on a fictional character?</strong></p>
<p>I know I&#8217;ve written here before that I&#8217;m really bad at having celebrity crushes. It just doesn&#8217;t seem plausible that anyone I don&#8217;t know would want a relationship with me, nor would I with someone I don&#8217;t know well. So while this all seems like nonsense to me, I&#8217;m going to give this my best shot and Steven will probably tease me later for being inadequate and lying. Anyway, I&#8217;m not really sure. As a child, I was very taken with <cite class="People">Ernestine Gilbreth</cite> of <cite class="Books">Cheaper by the Dozen</cite> and <cite class="Books">Belles on their Toes</cite>, although since they&#8217;re basically autobiographical that probably only counts on a technicality. I certainly idealized and adored and yearned for all three main characters in <cite class="People">Emma Donoghue</cite>&#8217;s <a href="../../../01/26/loca/index.html"><cite class="Books">Stir-Fry</cite></a>, which might be as close to a crush as I can get. I was often convinced as a child that if I could only meet the characters I was reading about, they would be better friends than any live children could be, and I suppose it&#8217;s this sense of cosmic rightness on an adult scale that&#8217;s what constitutes crushes of this sort. Boy, I&#8217;m not answering the question. Maybe I should move on and come back if I actually think of anything.</p>
<p><strong>The last book you bought is:</strong><br />
Not counting comics/trade paperbacks, it was probably when a trip to a used bookstore in Knoxville netted me a whole load of feminist theory stuff, especially several books on eating disorders for well under $1 each. Oh, and a very cool-looking book, <cite class="Books">The Medieval Greek Romance</cite>, which I haven&#8217;t begun yet. </p>
<p>I tend not to buy myself new books much because they&#8217;re so expensive and I&#8217;m so stingy. My rule used to be that I only bought very cheap books or books I knew I&#8217;d lend out, but I&#8217;ve loosened that rule a bit.</p>
<p><strong>The last book you read:</strong></p>
<p>Again, excepting all the comics I&#8217;ve been reading, I think the last book I finished would be <cite class="Books">The World According to Mimi Smartypants</cite>, which is a collection of posts from the blog of <a href="http://smartypants.diaryland.com/"><cite class="People">Mimi Smartypants</cite></a>. I&#8217;d already read all the posts in their original, more fun and hyperlinky context, but while I won&#8217;t go so far as to call this a character crush, I do sort of think of Mimi Smartypants as an alternate universe version of me, if I&#8217;d managed to do cool things and have better friends and druggier experiences and a different homelife, but with the same violin background and dorky Greek obsession. I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m admitting this on the blog, which is yet another proof that even if I&#8217;m right I am indeed the doofus version.</p>
<p>I read <cite class="People">Neal Stephenson</cite>&#8217;s <cite>The Baroque Cycle</cite> and <cite class="People">Susanna Clarke</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Books">Jonathan Strange &#038; Mr Norrell</cite> in fairly quick succession a few months ago and haven&#8217;t read much fiction since then, although I&#8217;m about to swing back in that direction.</p>
<p><strong>What are you currently reading?</strong></p>
<p>Oy. This is embarrassing, because as I said I&#8217;m very much between novels and so have a bunch of different things going and going slowly. Bedtime reading has been <cite class="People">Kim Chernin</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Books">The Hungry Self: Women, Eating, and Identity</cite>, which is not too exciting but still a seminal eating disorder book. Various articles from <cite class="Books">Feminism Beside Itself</cite> and <cite class="Books">The New Feminist Criticism</cite> show up as bathtime reading when I&#8217;m not featuring manga or a frivolous magazine. And then I really need to get back to <cite class="Books">Victorian Sappho</cite>, a book by <cite class="People">Yopie Prins</cite> on reinterpretations of Sappho&#8217;s poetry and biography/identity by Victorian poets, because I haven&#8217;t even gotten to the argument about how my beloved Swinburne&#8217;s uses of her meters have more to do with the way they sound like flogging than the extent to which they are direct homage. And of my birthday books, I must admit I&#8217;m only reading <cite class="Comics">Epileptic</cite> and slowly for some reason, I think to savor it. Usually I&#8217;m an unstoppable reader who devours things, but I&#8217;m taking my time here and haven&#8217;t even gotten out of the material covered in the first volume I&#8217;d already read. </p>
<p><strong>Five books you would take to a deserted island.</strong><br />
(Was anyone else annoyed by the way this quiz started with full sentences and fell away from it quickly?)</p>
<p><cite class="Books">Gravity&#8217;s Rainbow</cite>, by <cite class="People">Thomas Pynchon</cite>. <a href="http://completelyfutile.blogspot.com/"><cite class="People">Adam Stephanides</cite></a> is rereading it and now a blogless friend is reading it for the first time and I&#8217;m tempted to go back into it. It&#8217;s a book that could sustain many rereadings and hold me for a long time.</p>
<p><cite class="Books">I Capture the Castle</cite>, by <cite class="People">Dodie Smith</cite>. Maybe Cassandra should count as a crush, because her voice is one of the most amazing and consistent of any I&#8217;ve ever read. This book makes me laugh every time I read it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d need some giant poetry collection, Norton or something. I used to have an amazing two-volume set of 20th century poetry, <cite class="Books">Poems for the Millennium</cite>, but I&#8217;d need it to cover more time than that.</p>
<p>And since I think I&#8217;d want something to keep me cheerful, I&#8217;m going to go for a massive <cite class="People">P.G. Wodehouse</cite> collection of Jeeves &#038; Wooster stories over <cite class="People">Robert Benchley</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Books">My Ten Years in a Quandary and How They Grew</cite>, but it&#8217;s a tough decision and one I&#8217;d probably regret a bit eventually.</p>
<p>Fifth is going to be my cheaty one. I want <cite class="Book">The Odyssey</cite> in Greek, but of course my Greek isn&#8217;t good enough to just read it, so I need a dictionary and maybe a grammar and some pens and notebooks, which would help pass the rest of the time anyway. I figure this is no worse than people bringing the complete works of Dickens or something like that. And I won&#8217;t even try to sneak in <cite class="Books">The Iliad</cite> on analogous grounds, because they clearly have different authors and I clearly prefer one to the other. Although both Andromache and Hector give some potentially crush-worthy speeches&#8230;.
