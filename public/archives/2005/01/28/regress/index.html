<div class="text">
<p>I got to read <a href="http://www.eye.net/eye/issue/issue_01.27.05/city/panelist.html">the article in <cite class="News">The Eye</cite></a> that <a href="../../14/proposal/index.html#comments"><cite class="People">Bryan Lee O&#8217;Malley</cite> alluded to earlier</a> when it went live today. I have a long-running skepticism toward interviews where illustrative quotes are pulled out of the ether, so I&#8217;m curious about where this mention of a movie really came from. Did <cite class="People">Guy Leshinski</cite> say, &#8220;So, is this something you&#8217;d like to see play as a movie?&#8221; to get O&#8217;Malley to admit that &#8220;[t]he holy grail for cartoonists is the movie deal&#8221; or what? </p>
<p>I ask even though I have no right to ask, because it caused a crisis of conscience. I enjoyed <cite class="Comics">Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s Precious Little Life</cite> so much that I&#8217;m not even going to link to all the places where I talked about it because I know all my readers know this already. And because I talked about it so much, because I was an &#8220;early adopter,&#8221; Bryan Lee O&#8217;Malley contacted me and we ended up doing an interview in which I didn&#8217;t ask about movie options. That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m becoming some sort of hipster geek. My immediate response to the section of this profile asking about movie options was, &#8220;NO!!! Hollywood could never handle this right!!&#8221; That&#8217;s kind of goofy, since a <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite> movie wouldn&#8217;t even have to be a Hollywood movie, but I&#8217;m just being honest here. While I think the book deserves success and a wider audience (and the money/security audience brings its creator) something makes me want to think that this book is pure, that it&#8217;s not just another attempt at a movie deal. And those aren&#8217;t mutually exclusive; it could be a perfectly good comic (and certainly is) and also make a fine movie, but I&#8217;m so taken by the way it works as sequential art that I wouldn&#8217;t want to read a <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite> novel (and I&#8217;m lying a bit; I&#8217;d read it for sure) or hear what hot young actresses <a href="http://www.wizarduniverse.com/"><cite class="News">Wizard</cite></a> thinks would be even hotter as Kim or Ramona or Knives (and here I tell the truth). I want to just let things be themselves. But the flipside hipstery side of this is that I have to be sure I&#8217;m not saying this because I don&#8217;t want to be a person being neurotic that my favorite indie band is about to make it big and then I won&#8217;t be special anymore.  I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on, but I just as strongly hope that there isn&#8217;t going to be a movie made and I can keep these comics comics. After all, I&#8217;m glad that there&#8217;s more publicity and <a href="http://www.onipress.com/graphicnovels/gn.php?id=116">the next volume in less than a month</a>. I just want to spread the love, but seriously, there have to be lines!</p>
<p>And to prove I&#8217;m even more of a neurotic geek, although I don&#8217;t know how much hipsterism ties in here, I&#8217;m not asking for Mal to show up in the comments and set me straight about what happened, because I&#8217;m conflicted enough about knowing not all comics creators I write about live in a magical blog-free realm where nothing I say has any meaning. I just thought a good confession might make me feel better about this. And while I&#8217;m on this cleansing topic, <cite class="Books">Jonathan Strange &#038; Mr. Norrell</cite> <a href="http://www.longstoryshortpier.com/vaults/2004/11/28/magic_tricks">doesn&#8217;t need a sequel</a>. The end. (or is it?)

<p>&#8220;And while I????????m on this cleansing topic, Jonathan Strange &#038; Mr. Norrell doesn????????t need a sequel. The end.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree, and I find the prospect of a series unusually distressing.  It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t see the seeds for sequels in the book, but at the same time, it seems to defy what the book was about for me.  There was such a specificity to the world created and such an involving and detailed exploration of it that world (in part through the faux-scholarly construction) that a sequel seems almost&#8230; I don&#8217;t know, crass, or something.  It takes the &#8220;captured era&#8221; feel of the book and undermines it in an odd way.</p>
<p>This will make my partner happy, though.  We enjoyed the book equally, but he immediately assumed it was the launching point for a series, and I thought it was intended to stand alone.

<p>Apparently what&#8217;s going to happen is another story set in that world, not necessarily a where-are-they-now issue, but it honestly had not occurred to me on closing the last page that there could be a sequel. It felt like the story was closed, even though it&#8217;s a fairly open ending for basically all the characters. I&#8217;m still not sure why I feel so strongly about this, but it certainly seems that I do.</p>
<p>Although to be fair to <cite>Jonathan Strange</cite> and movie adaptations and any number of other things I claim I won&#8217;t like, I often make claims like that and they defninitely are sometimes wrong. I didn&#8217;t even want to read <cite class="Comic">Seaguy</cite> and it ended up one of my favorite comics of the year. I practically had to be dragged to <cite class="Movies">The Incredibles</cite> for no good reason and enjoyed it a lot. So I think I&#8217;m probably just a whiny hater more than someone with clear, consistent opinions.

<p>Well, he brought together a lot of disparate general statements and sort of massaged them into clever-sounding quotes. I mean, I think he was asking about how much money I made, and I probably did say something about a movie deal being the holy grail for a cartoonist, but this is in a <i>financial</i> sense. I mean, there is just no other way for someone in my position to become solidly established financially.</p>
<p>Mentioning the &#8220;Shaun of the Dead&#8221; guy was completely unrelated &#8212; I was probably talking about feedback, criticism, etcetera, and mentioned that I&#8217;d been told he&#8217;d read the book and liked it, in terms of validation.</p>
<p>That said: there <i>are</i> movie rumblings. It&#8217;s pure chance, the divine whimsy of Hollywood, and I&#8217;m sure you know I never wrote towards that, and I continue to write completely divorced from the idea of this possible movie process, but it does exist and I&#8217;m not <i>resistant</i> to it.

<p>I know it makes sense from a financial perspective, and the way quotes got stitched together makes sense too. I think my real point was that if there&#8217;s a bad <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite> movie someday, I&#8217;ll be awfully stompy.</p>
<p>But I would be perfectly happy with it being optioned for a movie (and the money that brings) and then made into something good or just dropped entirely eventually, as often happens.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://irresponsible.patachu.com/2005/01/pilgrimage.html">other</a> <a href="http://rateyourmusic.com/yaccs/commentsn/blog_id=90000042255_and_blog_entry_id=110684014698750650#7892661">readers</a> are clearly excited about the possibility. My reaction is just general me being grumpy and not trusting anything I don&#8217;t control myself. If I ran the world, among other things I would allow a good <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite> movie and would make sure comics creators got better pay.

<p>Funny, I&#8217;ve been thinking about movie adaptations lately, too.  Mainly, how a good movie adaptation can expose more people to a story but a bad movie can kill sales for a book.  </p>
<p>This is something I was talking to <a href="http://www.postmodernbarney.com/">Dorian</a> and <a href="http://www.progressiveruin.com/">Mike</a> at the store the other day where Dorian said a bad movie adaptation makes their job just a bit harder in terms of selling books.  I feel it&#8217;s unfair that a store and publisher have to depend on what a bunch of filmmakers are doing in Hollywood for a good chunk of business.  It&#8217;s great if a cartoonist like O&#8217;Malley can get a big payday and that&#8217;s regardless of if the film is a dud or not.  Still, a film is more likely to be bad than good and either way the film version will always be better known than the book.  A movie deal is a big risk and I&#8217;m wondering if it&#8217;s one that cartoonists and publishers should be eager to make.
