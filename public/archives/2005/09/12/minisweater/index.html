<div class="text">
<p><img src='https://peiratikos.net/wp/wp-content/images/mini.jpg' alt='Rose wearing her minisweater' width="225" height="300" class="lalign" />It&#8217;s sweater time again, although this is the last garment I&#8217;ll be showing for a while. This is the <a href="http://glampyreknits.tripod.com/glampyrephotos/id62.html">minisweater</a> designed by <a href="http://www.glampyre.com/blog/"><cite class="People">Stefanie Japel</cite></a>. I think I began on 1 September and ended 5 September or something like that, and I worked on several other projects at the same time. I deviated from the pattern quite a bit, but that&#8217;s sort of the point with this setup. Instead of worsted weight yarn I used very nearly all of two skeins of <a href="http://wiseneedle.com/yarndetail.asp?id=5134">Araucania Nature Wool Chunky</a> in a variegated bright green.  The body was knit on U.S. size 7 needles with the garter stitch edges done on U.S. 4 needles.</p>
<div class="calign"><img src='https://peiratikos.net/wp/wp-content/images/mini_back.jpg' alt='detail of minisweater back' width="300" height="325" /></div>
<p>I used yarnover increases to make decorative eyelets along the raglan seams.  I made straight raglan sleeves, omitting the puffed portion, and threw in a few short rows. The sleeves are also not as long as the ones in the original pattern because I was running out of yarn. I think I got through 5 rows before starting the garter stitch border. I made two more sets of increases on the body after separating the stitches that make up the arms, although this may not have been a great idea as the back is just a tiny bit loose. The button also wants to come undone, so I may end up taking it out and moving it so the fronts have more overlap where they meet, which would then tighten up the extra space in the back.</p>
<div class="calign"><img src='https://peiratikos.net/wp/wp-content/images/mini_front.jpg' alt='detail of minisweater front' width="300" height="234" /></div>
<p>And here is the front with its button closure. Moving the button would give me slightly more coverage, although coverage clearly isn&#8217;t really the point of this design. Because it&#8217;s wool and knit much less loosely than the garment in the pattern, it seems very warm and should be a great coverup to let me keep wearing tank tops into the fall. The fabric is very fuzzy but doesn&#8217;t seem to be pilling and doesn&#8217;t leave fluff on my clothes. And I chose a red button on purpose, because I had a theme for this sweater and that theme was TURTLE.</p>
<p><img src='https://peiratikos.net/wp/wp-content/images/foucault_profile.jpg' alt='Rose\&#39;s turtle, Foucault' width="140" height="110" class="lalign" />This is Foucault, my six-year-old red-eared slider (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trachemys scripta elegans</i>).  He doesn&#8217;t actually live in the sink, but I was scrubbing out his tank tonight and figured this was a good opportunity for a photo shoot. Since he&#8217;s a mature turtle, his shell is fairly dark now, but I like the combination of various greens and a spot of red and used a color scheme more reminiscent of his looks as a hatchling. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll get the following that some comics bloggers&#8217; pets have, but that&#8217;s okay. Being a turtle, he values his privacy.

<p>I&#8217;m certainly a fan of your turtle now!</p>
<p>Have you ever thought of selling sweaters, by any chance?

<p>Hey, Ed. I&#8217;m a fan too. He&#8217;s a pretty cool turtle, even if he did claw up my palm yesterday. (I can&#8217;t really blame him for not wanting to be taken out of his tank. I always try to tell him it&#8217;s for his own good and I just need to clean, but apparently he forgets.)</p>
<p>I have not thought of selling sweaters for a number of reasons. I typically use (or at least bastardize) a pattern someone else has written rather than hacking everything out for myself, which means someone else owns the copyright and (typically) it would be illegal for me to sell such a sweater. But also the cost would be prohibitive for any buyers. The yarn for this sweater cost $16, which is probably more than I&#8217;d be willing to pay for a sweater in a store because I&#8217;m totally cheap, and if you then factor in the hours spent working on it (at least 10, I&#8217;d think) you&#8217;re talking about $75 or so for this little thing. Plus then I&#8217;d have to deal with the actual marketing and whatnot. Ugh.</p>
<p>I do knit gifts for people I actually know and I suppose I&#8217;d take requests, but I mostly end up knitting for myself because I can choose something I think I&#8217;ll like and monkey around until it really fits me. I just ripped out almost an entire sweater because I thought it would be too loose and blobby, and I&#8217;d hate to do that if knitting on a deadline or for someone else, but for me it was worth it and now I&#8217;ve got the yarn working up in a different sweater and I&#8217;ll get new yarn better suited to <a href="http://www.girlfromauntie.com/patterns/shop/eris/detail.php">the original sweater</a>. I like to have that kind of flexibility. But I&#8217;m also finishing a gift shawl in the next day or so, and I have made shawls and scarves and socks and hats and a sweater as gifts for various people, mostly relatives.
