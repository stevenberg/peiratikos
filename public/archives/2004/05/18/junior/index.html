<div class="text">
<p>If comics publishers went to an <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes-style distribution</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1569719888/qid=1084844627/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-2379115-2976620?v=glance&#038;s=books&#038;n=507846"><cite class="Comics">Hellboy Junior</cite></a> would be my first nomination. See, I don&#8217;t want the full album. The <cite>Hellboy Junior</cite> trade has some tracks I really, really love and others that I basically don&#8217;t want in my house.</p>
<p>The Hellbaby part is irresistible, a little red fellow in a diaper. I&#8217;m sold! But the rest of it has a lot of problems (ok, and so does the Hellbaby stuff, but I&#8217;ll get to that) and I can&#8217;t resolve them. There&#8217;s a certain attitude of <em>Hey, we&#8217;re all good-minded liberals, so we can laugh at racist/sexist/homophobic/generally offensive humor because we know better than to mean it, unlike those awful insensitive people!</em> and it bothers me. And unfortunately this means that I&#8217;m not at all interested in stories about &#8220;Huge Retarded Duck&#8221; or &#8220;The Ginger Beef Boy,&#8221; and so the only non-Hellboy comic I enjoyed was &#8220;Squid of Man,&#8221; by <cite class="People">Bill Wray</cite> and <cite class="People">Mike Mignola</cite>, a dark, inconsequential little story about the ups and downs of love in the home of a mad scientist. Apparently most of these stories take old Harvey comics characters and add in morbid sex jokes, but I&#8217;m don&#8217;t think knowing the source material would have increased my appreciation. I just don&#8217;t think looking at pictures of My Little Ponies having sex is funny, subversive or worth my time. I&#8217;m sure in the right context it could be, but I didn&#8217;t find that in any of the stories here. </p>
<p>The problem is not necessarily that I prefer my humor to be tasteful. Almost all the comics about Hellboy Junior, whom I prefer to call Hellbaby because it&#8217;s as cute as he and doesn&#8217;t imply weird paternity issues with Hellboy Senior,  prominently feature Adolf Hitler. Idi Amin makes a guest appearance too. Somehow an endless string of tasteless maggot-eating jokes seem palatable to me, and even the story that mocks a transvestite witch redeems itself, but &#8220;let&#8217;s play <strong>shove the retard!</strong>&#8221; just isn&#8217;t funny. I think this is partly because Hellbaby is a recurring character, so it&#8217;s funny and poignant to see him try and fail again and again, but also he is a character. He has wants and desires and dislikes (maggots!) and he trusts people when he shouldn&#8217;t and then suffers for it. He&#8217;s a likeable little guy, gruff and petulant and red and diapered, just what anyone would want in a little devil. </p>
<p>I grabbed <cite>Hellboy Junior</cite> off the shelf and bought it solely because I&#8217;ve been obsessed with Hellbaby for months, and it met my Hellbaby needs all right. I&#8217;m just not sure I can recommend it except to people who consider <a href="http://www.maakies.com/"><cite class="Comics">Maakies</cite></a> a bit mild or who have fantasized since childhood about the adventures of &#8220;Wheezy the Sick Little Witch.&#8221; It&#8217;s not really the offensiveness of <cite>Hellboy Junior</cite> that annoys (more than offends, really) me, but the juvenile pride it seems to take in that offensiveness. If you&#8217;re going to revel in your depravity, can&#8217;t you do a little better than making incest jokes about poultry? I know from the back of the book that these are supposed to be &#8220;some of the funniest and most original comics ever to haunt the shelves,&#8221; but I&#8217;m not impressed. And I know that they&#8217;re only being made so that people like me will say, &#8220;Oh, but you can&#8217;t joke about <em>that</em>,&#8221; which is not quite what I&#8217;m saying. You can joke about it all you want, but I&#8217;ll be unimpressed and not laugh, unless you somehow manage to be really funny. </p>
<p>But there&#8217;s plenty of cutely hideous art with spectacular facial expressions. The Hellbaby stories do manage to get in a Nuremberg joke, which is one of my specialties, as well as a horrible, horrible, excellent Bob Dylan joke I didn&#8217;t get until my second read. I think I may just not give the stories I disliked another read, but the ones surrounding them should still hold up fine.

<p>Shane, I guess I did see that and had had it at the back of my mind when I made that comment, but I can never remember where things are when I want them. I&#8217;ll comment more on your blog, but I don&#8217;t think the system you propose would be financially feasible or in the interests of Marvel and DC at least, since I don&#8217;t see how it would do anything to enhance shareholder value, but it&#8217;s an interesting idea and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if parts of it show up in the future.
