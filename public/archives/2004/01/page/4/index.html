<p>Yes, that is the actual caption on today&#8217;s <cite class="Comics">Family Circus</cite>. Is it a joke about supermarkets marking up their prices? I do not know. Now it&#8217;s an HTML joke, go me.

<p><a href="http://www.tcj.com/journalista/zarch200401A.html#other4">Dirk Deppey sez</a>, in attempting to refute John Byrne&#8217;s arguments against original graphic novels (a noble, if not difficult, endeavor): </p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.tcj.com/journalista/zarch200401A.html#other4"><p>Moreover, consider the notion that no one will pay for a $20 book without having read it in pamphlet form first. Can anyone who&#8217;s given the bookstore market even a cursory examination do anything but laugh? How does Byrne think hardcover prose novels sell? The argument&#8217;s equally idiotic where graphic novels are concerned. Picture Craig Thompson, Joe Sacco and Marjane Satrapi smacking their foreheads and crying, &#8220;Why, God, why didn&#8217;t I listen to John Byrne when I had the chance!?!&#8221; Mind you, Thompson, Sacco and Satrapi produce works that the average person in the street might actually want to <strong>read</strong>&#8230; </p></blockquote>
<p>While I understand the argument he&#8217;s making, that people choose what to read largely based on reviews and recommendations rather than just wanting extra copies in different formats of books they&#8217;ve already read, it might have been a bit stronger if more than one out of the three examples worked primarily in original graphic novels. Maybe 1.5, if we count making two volumes of <a href=" http://www.marsimport.com/display_comic.php?ID=1903">French</a> <a href="http://www.marsimport.com/display_comic.php?ID=2855"><cite>Persepolis</cite></a> into one book for the anglophone market as still dealing in graphic novels. It&#8217;s a story told in segments, of which the <a href="http://www.marsimport.com/display_comic.php?ID=5100">version</a> I read is one, but so are its constituent books and the other parts of the series. Maybe the issue is that 80 pages in French b/w does not a pamphlet make? I don&#8217;t know how anyone could claim Sacco was saving is work for his graphic novels, though, since <a href="http://www.marsimport.com/display_comic?ID=2080"><cite>Safe Area Gorazde</cite></a> (and I apologize to any linguistic purists that html doesn&#8217;t seem to allow me to use the proper &#8220;z&#8221;) had the preceding comics journalism he had published in various venues during the war serving as a teaser for discerning readers and <a href="http://www.marsimport.com/display_comic?ID=4639"><cite>Notes from a Defeatist</cite></a> is a collection of previously published works.  I don&#8217;t follow Deppey closely, though, and I&#8217;m not sure how limiting his definition of a graphic novel is.  Is <cite>Persepolis</cite> a limited series? Is <cite>Notes from a Defeatist</cite> not a graphic novel in that it&#8217;s not a novel by standard criteria, whatever those are?  I really don&#8217;t know and it&#8217;s not a question that interests me.</p>
<p>Anyway, yes, it&#8217;s good that people read works that are interesting and getting a lot of critical attention, like the books of all three cited writers. I also believe it&#8217;s bad to take John Byrne seriously, but perhaps someone&#8217;s gotta do it. The truly horrifying thing is that people do, and concur. </p>
<p>And on a last and unrelated note, Deppey says Byrne &#8220;stands athwart history and says &#8216;Stop!&#8217;&#8221; a quick <a href="http://switch2.netrics.com/cgi-bin/nro.cgi?s=stands+athwart+history&#038;submit=search&#038;db=nationalreview&#038;account=nro">search</a> shows that perhaps Byrne should have been yelling, but maybe he just doesn&#8217;t have as much energy as the young William F. Buckley, Jr. I&#8217;m frightened I caught the reference and want to know whether it was supposed to have political implications about Deppey&#8217;s already  uncloaked opinions about John Byrne or whether it&#8217;s a throwaway line. Both, probably.

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/03/arts/03EAGL.html">Cultural theory is dead</a>! (Link from <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1073367229#195821">David Fiore</a>.)</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/03/arts/03EAGL.html"><p>In this age of terrorism, he [Terry Eagleton] says, cultural theory has become increasingly irrelevant, because theorists have failed to address the big questions of morality, metaphysics, love, religion, revolution, death and suffering.&#8221; &#8230; The postmodern prejudice against norms, unities and consensuses is a politically catastrophic one,&#8221; he writes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now this is apparently a standard criticism of postmodernist theory, that it rejects norms and consensuses. You so crazy, Terry Eagleton! What postmodernists reject norms and consensuses? Stupid ones, I guess? I don&#8217;t. I say, as a postmodernist, we have nothing but norms and consensuses. But see, (some) non-postmoderists seem to think something like, &#8220;If we see a consensus among humans, that&#8217;s probably indicative of some kind of absolute or truth or something like that.&#8221; But postmodernists, or postmodernists who think like I do anyway, think more like, &#8220;Well, we have this consensus, so we&#8217;d better deal with that and not worry too much about whether it&#8217;s a universal absolute truth or whatever.&#8221; See how that&#8217;s different than a rejection of norms and <del datetime="2004-01-08T10:26:00 +00:00">consensuses</del> consensi? It&#8217;s a loving embrace of them.

<p><a href="http://www.tiffany.com/">Tiffany jewelry</a> offers the perfect reward for a <a href="http://www.tiffany.com/quickorder/browse.asp?cid=K03&#038;page=35&#038;">hard-working mother</a>, a $7K diamond watch suitable for diaper changing!  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m really not sure who the target audience is. I assume it&#8217;s not 1950s-era glamour girls with new babies, and it&#8217;s presumably not for people who imagine themselves that way, since that seems like a fairly specialized fetish. But do people who appreciate irony spend thousands at Tiffany?  Some must, I suppose.  I certainly don&#8217;t.  And yet I&#8217;m fascinated with the picture.  I&#8217;d appreciate a poster, even. But it doesn&#8217;t make me want a watch, only an explanation.</p>
<p>I guess fashion photography has its own idioms. I enjoyed the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> weekend magazine spreads in my early teens for their sheer lunacy, the high-gloss hideousness they portrayed with a poker face so that I never knew if people really wore parts of these outfits or if the whole industry was a colossal joke.  Even crazier are the ads for perfumes, since anything beyond the despised stinky envelopes in magazines or mailings is only about conveying a mood, and I really don&#8217;t see the connection between my self-esteem and scented water, but perhaps that&#8217;s a personal flaw.  I&#8217;m also wondering who&#8217;s sold on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/04/magazine/04CONSUMED.html">right-hand diamond</a> phenomenon (temporary link, requires free login), a marketing campaign designed by the diamond cartel to get women to buy themselves diamond rings, since engagement ring sales aren&#8217;t doing enough for the industry.  I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s terribly liberating not to wait around for a ring, but why not just ditch the diamonds altogether if the symbology of the engagement ring is so oppressive?</p>
<p>Then again, I&#8217;m not immune to the power of advertising images.  I went head-over-heels for a car commercial (I thought Volkswagen, but I can&#8217;t find anything about it on their website) showing a South Asian American family.  There wasn&#8217;t anything special about the commercial, but it was so refreshing to see a &#8220;different&#8221; look from what&#8217;s usually given that I got all excited and happy.  This is yet one more reason I don&#8217;t watch much tv.</p>

<p>This just in! <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/wire/2004/01/07/simpson/index.html">Jessica Simpson isn&#8217;t pregnant!</a> Not only that, but she <em>doesn&#8217;t even plan to become pregnant any time soon!</em> Moreover, if she were pregnant, she probably wouldn&#8217;t star in a show about it on MTV. Stay tuned for more updates in this shocking turn of events.</p>
<p>I realize celebrity worship is big and that I&#8217;m utterly unamerican for not having a celebrity crush (and maybe for other reasons) but I really hope there was some context to this other than &#8220;Britney&#8217;s in the news; better put out a press release.&#8221; That still doesn&#8217;t explain why anyone would publish it, though.</p>
<p>And just for the record, me, I&#8217;m not pregnant. Not even looking for a dog.  Everything&#8217;s just a-ok, not that anyone asked me either.

<p>And another thing about Internet Explorer! It doesn&#8217;t display PNGs properly. If you&#8217;re viewing this page on IE, you won&#8217;t see a lovable little pirate underneath the Peiratikos title (by the way, &#8220;peiratikos&#8221; is an Ancient Greek word which, being translated, is &#8220;pirate,&#8221; or &#8220;pirates,&#8221; or something like that).

<p><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/bbaugh/iblog/">Bruce Baugh</a> <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/bbaugh/iblog/C720713518/E772055071/">uses <cite>Dungeons &#038; Dragons</cite> to illustrate some very basic concepts of deconstructionism</a>. I think I don&#8217;t like the term &#8220;deconstructionism.&#8221; I think deconstruction is a fine critical strategy, but I don&#8217;t see that it needs to be elevated to an ism. I mean, it&#8217;s <ins datetime="2004-01-08T00:33:00 +00:00">a</ins> pretty basic and obvious (to me, anyway) concept&#8212;meaning is unstable, hierarchies and oppositions in texts are unstable and deconstruct themselves. Actually deconstruction doesn&#8217;t destroy stability of meaning, it shifts the site of meaning creation from the text to the reader. Well, meaning is not so concrete&#8230; meaning is not objective. Shall we say it is subjective? I say no. After all, there isn&#8217;t one Reader of a text, but many, readers who analyze and critique and discuss. Stanley Fish&#8217;s idea of interpretive communities. Meaning is a social construct. That is a central concept of postmodernism as I think of it.</p>
<p>Which is not to say I think there&#8217;s any problem with Mr. Baugh&#8217;s blog post. That&#8217;s a great little essay, I hope he writes much more.
