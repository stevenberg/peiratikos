<p class="postmeta"><a href="index.html" title="November 2004 Archive">23 November 2004</a> by <a href="mailto:s&#116;even&#46;m&#46;&#98;&#101;rg&#64;gm&#97;il.com" title="Send an e-mail to Steven">Steven</a> &#8212; Filed under <a href="../../../categories/criticism/index.html" title="View all posts in Criticism" rel="category tag">Criticism</a></p>
<div class="text">
<p><a href="https://peiratikos.net/archives/2004/11/10/reading/">I wondered what people even mean when they say something &#8220;took them out of a story.&#8221;</a> <a href="http://www.forager23.com/archives/000299.html"><cite class="People">J.W. Hastings</cite> explains what they mean</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, saying &#8220;X took me out of the story&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean that &#8220;Until X I thought that the story was real and then all of a sudden I got dumped back into reality&#8221;, which is what both Steven and Dave are arguing, but rather that &#8220;X broke the mood&#8221; or that &#8220;X broke the rules&#8221;. [&#8230;] saying &#8220;X took me out of the story&#8221; isn&#8217;t so much about breaking &#8220;suspension of disbelief&#8221; or puncturing an illusionist surface as it is about an audience member feeling that the art maker has broken the rules of a game they were playing or that the art maker has failed to properly set up or cue a change in these rules.</p></blockquote>
<p>In fact, I have witnessed people use the phrase to mean, &#8220;Until X I thought that the story was real and then all of a sudden I got dumped back into reality.&#8221; (Not that I can point to specific examples of people using the phrase with such a connotation, so take my claim with a grain of salt if you don&#8217;t have your own anecdotal evidence to back it up.) On the other hand, J.W. is correct in suggesting that I should not have yoked the phrase so securely to the illusionist school of experiencing art implied in the phrase &#8220;willing suspension of disbelief.&#8221; J.W.&#8217;s explanation of the phrase probably applies more often than not.</p>
<blockquote><p>But I think what is underlying what both Steven and Dave are saying is their belief that being truly engaged with a work of art means analyzing and interpreting it. I even get a sense that they feel that an audience has a kind of moral imperative to analyze and interpret a work of art, or that this kind of analysis and interpretation is morally superior to old-fashioned &#8220;appreciation&#8221; of art works. [&#8230;] Steven and Dave, of course, aren&#8217;t alone. Their kind of analytical criticism is practiced throughout academia. Personally, I think that this almost obsessive focus on analysis and interpretation has led to a whole bunch of &#8220;art critics&#8221; who don????????t have anything resembling traditional aesthetic sense. By approaching works of art merely as a group of symbols that need to be decoded in order to discover their &#8220;meaning&#8221;, these critics have cut themselves off from being able to appreciate the beauty of, to take pleasure in, or to be moved by a work of art. In fact, it becomes impossible for them to differentiate between, say, a Willem De Kooning painting and an advertisement for toothpaste. After all, both the painting and the advertisement are equally suitable objects for critical analysis and interpretation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ooh. A De Kooning painting and a toothpaste ad? In my defense, I&#8217;ve never done critical analysis of a toothpaste ad&#8212;nor a De Kooning painting, for that matter. A De Kooning painting and a toothpaste ad, equally suitable objects for critical analysis? Hardly! (Which is not to say a toothpaste ad isn&#8217;t suitable for critical analysis&#8212;maybe it is sometimes.)</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not talking about paintings or toothpaste ads, I&#8217;m talking about works of narrative art which, more often than not, have large verbal components. So what <em>does</em> constitute &#8220;old-fashioned &#8216;appreciation&#8217;&#8221; of narrative art, if it doesn&#8217;t include interepretation and analysis&#8212;however informal and schematic?

<div class="text">
<p>This was supposed to be the night I announced I was going on hiatus through the end of the month, but suddenly it seems that may not be the case.  Today was full of all sorts of comics, <cite class="Comics">Y: The Last Man</cite> and <cite class="Comics">How Loathsome</cite> and <cite class="Comics">The Nikopol Trilogy</cite> and <cite class="Comics">Spider-Man India</cite> and <cite class="Comics">The Originals</cite> and <cite class="Comics">The Question</cite> and <cite class="Comics">X-Statix</cite>. That last one is where this post comes in, although there are points I want to make about <cite>Y</cite> as well. And for some reason the &#8220;IBCD&#8221; joke in <cite>Spider-Man India</cite> made me giggle a lot.</p>
<p>But the most important thing on my mind is a question about who on earth writes the &#8220;Previously&#8230;&#8221; text at the beginning of <cite>X-Statix</cite>. Not only does this begin with the positively sick-making, &#8220;X-Statix has scaled the mountain of Professor Xavier&#8217;s dream to new heights,&#8221; but it then manages to drop to not-so-new grammatical depths.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dear <cite class="People">Peter Milligan</cite>, <cite class="People">Axel Alonso</cite>, <cite class="People">Jennifer Lee</cite>, <cite class="People">Jeff Youngquist</cite>, <cite class="People">Jennifer Gr&uuml;nwald</cite>, <cite class="People">Joe Quesada</cite>: </p>
<p>Is it terribly, terribly difficult to differentiate between transitive and intransitive verbs? I&#8217;ll give you a hint, even &#8212; NO. That is why it made me scream to read about &#8220;Lacuna, who now lays recovering in intensive care.&#8221;  You know who&#8217;s really sick? The person who made that ridiculous error and all the people who didn&#8217;t scream upon seeing it as it went off to the printer. And now me, too.</p>
<p>Disappointedly yours,<br />
Rose</p></blockquote>
<p>Admittedly I was sick to begin with, which is why I&#8217;m heading off to bed now and one of the reasons you probably won&#8217;t see much of me for the next few weeks (not that this differentiates them much from the last few). After some more time lying down, I will recover, but luckily I had so little faith in the technical writing skills of most comics folks that I won&#8217;t let that keep me down.

<div class="text">
<p>The only comic book I&#8217;ve read recently is <cite class="Comics">JLA Classified</cite>, which is a fun superhero comic, a slippery polysemic critique of US foreign policy, a parody of the grim (and <em>dull</em>) superteam pastiches of <cite class="Comics">The Authority</cite> and <cite class="Comics">The Ultimates</cite>, and a playful subversion of Batman&#8217;s coherence as a character. <a href="http://gutterninja.blogspot.com/2004/11/this-universe-aint-big-enough-for-both.html"><cite class="People">Steve Pheley</cite></a> quotes <a href="http://www.thefourthrail.com/reviews/critiques/110104/jlaclassified1.shtml"><cite class="People">Don MacPherson</cite></a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.thefourthrail.com/reviews/critiques/110104/jlaclassified1.shtml"><p>The problem isn&#8217;t that this Batman is different, it&#8217;s that Morrison tries to maintain both are the same man. &#8220;I&#8217;m opening the sci-fi closet, Alfred. Don&#8217;t tell my friends in the G.C.P.D. about this.&#8221; The notion that the Batman who patrols Gotham, trying to prevent the sort of tragedy that scarred him as a youth, would have a box full of seemingly magical toys just doesn&#8217;t wash. [&#8230;] It took me out of the story.</p></blockquote>
<p>to which Steve replies cogently:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://gutterninja.blogspot.com/2004/11/this-universe-aint-big-enough-for-both.html"><p>Me, I tend to think it&#8217;s perfectly valid to have Solo Batman and JLA Batman being different, and blurring the lines between the two is fine if the tone of the story allows it (as the <cite>Classified</cite> story does). Call it Hypertime, call it selective continuity, call it fudging &#8212; why not, if you can get a good story out of it?</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It took me out of the story.&#8221; &#8220;It took me out of the story.&#8221; When people say this, I feel like Brad Stand in <cite class="Movies">I &hearts; Huckabees</cite>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>People</dt>
<dd>&#8220;It took me out of the story.&#8221;</dd>
<dt>Me</dt>
<dd>&#8220;That is so not true. Wait, what does that even <em>mean</em>?&#8221;</dd>
</dl>
<p>What are people doing in the story in the first place? They&#8217;re readers, not characters. OK, I&#8217;m being deliberately obtuse. But people talk about being immersed in the story, forgetting they&#8217;re reading a book or watching a movie. That can&#8217;t be what they mean. How could they really forget that they&#8217;re scanning a sequence of words (or images) on a page, or that they&#8217;re watching a sequence of images projected on a screen? And &#8220;willing suspension of disbelief.&#8221; I think people don&#8217;t mean this literally&#8212;how could they, and why would they want to, believe that the story they&#8217;re reading is true?&#8212;but the language of forgetfulness and belief seems unhelpful, at least for me. I want to remember, not forget, that I&#8217;m reading a text.</p>
<p>This language must be related to that some people hate criticism and analysis of texts. They complain that dissecting a text takes all the fun out of it&#8212;maybe because it forces them to abandon their strategies of immersive forgetfulness and belief, which seem childish and na&iuml;ve to me.
