<div class="text">
<p>Part three in a four-part series on <cite class="Comics">From Beyond the Unknown</cite> #23! Previous installments include <a href="https://peiratikos.net/archive/2004/03/31/language-master-of-space/">&#8220;Language-Master of Space!&#8221;</a> and <a href="https://peiratikos.net/archive/2004/03/30/secret-of-the-man-ape/">&#8220;Secret of the Man-Ape!&#8221;</a> Today, &#8220;World of Doomed Spacemen!&#8221; Story by Gardner Fox, art by Mike Sekowsky and Bernard Sachs. (Part four will be the letters column, which is pretty interesting in itself.)</p>
<blockquote><p>A deserted Earth spaceship with no sign of its crew&#8212;a fantastic giant who was the only living thing on a far distant planet&#8212;! Had the giant destroyed the Earthmen? Or was there a stranger menace waiting to doom the rescue ships from Earth?</p>
<p>[Rescue ship crewman:] &#8220;The giant snapped us up like a pair of toy spaceships! What&#8217;s he going to do to us?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an episode in an ongoing Space Museum series, the premise of which is that a son and his father go to the Space Museum and discover some odd and intriguing artifact on display. &#8220;Behind every object in the Space Museum there&#8217;s a story of heroism, daring, self-sacrifice&#8230;&#8221; a story which little Tommy Parker&#8217;s father tells him. This episode, Tommy and his dad find a pair of contact lenses. And let me tell you, these are some <em>huge</em> contacts. They&#8217;re like the size of an entire eyeball! Why are people in the 25th century still wearing contacts, anyway? They also drive flying cars that have <em>wheels</em>. Why do they have wheels if they fly? I guess for landing, but come on, how about vertical landing/take-off? The people of the future are slackers if this is the best technological advancement they can come up with.</p>
<p>But back to contact lenses. What is the story of heroism, daring, and self-sacrifice behind a pair of contact lenses? Glad you asked! The contacts belonged to Tom Miller of the Star-Gazer, the first manned spaceship to travel to the stars! During its maiden voyage, the Star-Gazer is lost somewhere between the Sirius and Procyon systems&#8230; Earth sends out two rescue ships! As the commander of one ship explains, &#8220;If the lead ship runs into the same disaster, the follow-up one will try to save it&#8212;or at least determine the menace!&#8221; Astute readers will do doubt catch the logical problem here&#8212;it&#8217;s sort of a &#8220;Who watches the watchmen?&#8221; for spaceships&#8230; who rescues the rescue ship? Who rescues the rescue-rescue ship? And so on. Sending <em>two</em> rescue ships is only a partial solution, but the problem is that a partial solution is the best you can manage. Sending a backup rescue ship to rescue the rescue ship wouldn&#8217;t really significantly increase the probability of a successful rescue mission. You just have to hope the rescue crew are smart and don&#8217;t get into trouble themselves. As the story continues, the futility of a backup rescue ship is effectively demonstrated. The rescuers track the Star-Gazer to the planet Procyon, but as soon as they arrive on Procyon a giant shows up and grabs <em>both</em> rescue ships. The backup ship was totally useless!</p>
<p>Luckily for the rescuers, the giant is a friendly giant. In fact, when the giant uses a machine to reduce himself, it turns out it&#8217;s Commander Tom Miller! How did Commander Miller find himself giant-sized? Well, after the Star-Gazer landed on Procyon, its crew began disappearing one by one, until none but Commander Miller was left. As Commander Miller searched the barren landscape for his crewmates, a voice spoke to him inside his head! &#8220;Follow my thoughts, man of Earth! Your friends are with me, waiting for you&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>[Commander Miller:] &#8220;The voice in my mind explained that it belonged to a mighty robot of inestructible metal! It had been created on a far-distant planet called Strykor&#8230; Not content with life on Strykor, Extar the Robot decided to journey to other worlds&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>[Extar the Robot:] &#8220;All I need to teleport myself across space is mind-energy&#8212;which I&#8217;ll absorb from the people on this planet&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s an important lesson here. If you build a robot, <strong>do not give it the ability to eat minds</strong>. If you insist on giving it the ability to eat minds, <strong>do not give it the ability to decide to eat <em>your</em> mind</strong>. People <em>always</em> get this wrong&#8212;they make a killer robot and the robot goes crazy and kills them. Obviously the people of Strykor were not <cite class="People">Isaac Asimov</cite> fans.</p>
<p>Extar absorbed the mind energy of the Strykorians, teleported to Procyon, and got stuck there because Procyonian civilization is long dead&#8212;no mind-energy to absorb! Luckily, Commander Miller and Co. arrived. But wait&#8212;Extar was able to mind-control the Star-Gazer crew, but when he tried to mind-control Commander Miller he failed miserably! (Can you guess why?) The Commander narrowly escaped, discovered the enlarging/shrinking machine, and enlarged himself in preparation for battle with Extar the Robot.</p>
<p>Now, did you guess why Extar was unable to mind-control Commander Miller? If you guessed that the mind-control rays were distorted due to the refractive index of the glass, and thus failed to strike the control centers of the commander&#8217;s brain&#8230; you are correct!</p>
<p>Commander Miller and the rescue crew form a battle plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bust into the robot&#8217;s lair</li>
<li>Throw the enlarging/shrinking machine at the robot (distraction, see?)</li>
<li>Put glass space helmets on the mind-controlled Star-Gazer crew</li>
</ol>
<p>Brilliant plan, right? But there&#8217;s one problem: the mind-controlled crewmembers are <em>still</em> even after they get space helments! Commander Miller, Space Sleuth, deduces that &#8220;The robot must have changed the frequency of its mental rays to allow for the distortion of the glass, figuring to capture me this way!&#8221; Commander Miller leaps into action and operates the englarging/shrinking machine to shrink Extar to subatomic size! Another crew member, now free of the robotic mind control, marvels, &#8220;The robot&#8217;s so small now that it is on one of the uncounted trillions of sub-atomic worlds! It&#8217;ll never find its way back! Our universe is now safe!&#8221; Wow, uncounted trillions of sub-atomic worlds&#8230; Commander Miller replies, &#8220;The machine used up all its power in shrinking Extar! It&#8217;s useless to us now because we don&#8217;t know on what fuel it operates!&#8221; Alas!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering how Commander Miller avoided being mind-controlled after the robot altered the frequency of its mind-control ray, you&#8217;re not alone:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Tommy:] &#8220;But, Dad, how did Commander Miller prevent the robot from overcoming him as it did the others?&#8221;</p>
<p>[Dad:] &#8220;When he realized that the robot had altered its mental waves to compensate for glass, Miller removed his contact lenses&#8212;an thus Extar&#8217;s mental waves couldn&#8217;t overcome him!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Luckily, Commander Miller&#8217;s eyesight wasn&#8217;t <em>too</em> bad without his contacts in. It&#8217;d be pretty embarrassing to be fighting an evil robot and trip on a chair or something because you&#8217;re too blind to see it.

I&#8217;m pretty sure that the guy at <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1080309673#244687">Mars Comics in Montreal</a> must have read this story at some point in his youth and taken its lesson to heart. He is morbidly sensitive about the threat robots pose to our well-being&#8230;</p>
