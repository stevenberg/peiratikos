<div class="text">
<p><strong>As Steven said, we saw <cite class="People">Quentin Tarantino</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill Vol. 2</cite> this weekend, and in preparation for saying more, I&#8217;m reposting my comments on <cite>Vol. 1</cite> from the older version of our blog. I&#8217;ve standardized formatting and switched to gendered pronouns from Spivak varient nongendered pronouns.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Originally posted 29 October 2003</strong></p>
<p>Last week was a much-needed vacation not from work but, to a large extent, from the Internet. Now I&#8217;m back, refreshed and exhausted and working 10-hour days.</p>
<p>In the interim, though, I saw <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill</cite> and I&#8217;ve been writing and thinking about it in relation to everything else I run into. It was a very frustrating half-movie, all the more so because I feel unable to critique it fully without recourse to the story&#8217;s end. All I&#8217;ve got are a bunch of references and reminders and preliminary theories, and they all make me want more. I&#8217;m not sure if that means it&#8217;s a good movie. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d talk about it in those terms, but it&#8217;s compelling to me and I enjoyed watching the later parts, although the first half hour or so (maybe hour, one of the benefits of wearing no watch) left me awkwardly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I held off posting at first after seeing it because what I was going to say was too personal, and because I thought that most of the failure was my own. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;ve changed these views, but just that I don&#8217;t see the point of not saying anything just because I&#8217;m unable to escape autobiographical criticism.</p>
<p>I have very strong views about rape. It&#8217;s an issue that impacts me directly and strongly. I&#8217;m interested in theory that surrounds sexual assault and can discuss it intellectually, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that I can give up my instinctual emotional impact, either. And <cite>Kill Bill</cite> really annoyed me on this front. I now have an alternate explanation for the way the scenes went, but I want to talk about my immediate understanding of and annoyance with the scenes involving The Bride and Buck, the hospital worker who sold her body while she was comatose.</p>
<p>First of all, <cite>Kill Bill</cite> is in many ways a superficial movie that seems basically devoid of social commentary. I mean, it&#8217;s not terribly difficult to interpret various stances and arguments into the movie, but, particularly because we don&#8217;t have all the data, it&#8217;s very difficult to see if there are moral judgments at work or just what Tarantino is doing. I know this.</p>
<p>Still, it seemed to me problematic and cowardly that Tarantino broadly stereotyped the rapists in the film in the way he did. Buck and the hapless redneck whose name I didn&#8217;t catch (if it was ever given) are nasty, miserable, ugly people. Both of them die in nasty, bloody ways as The Bride awakens to begin her arc of revenge, taking as spoils Buck&#8217;s outrageous &#8220;Pussy Wagon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The trouble for me is that unlike anyone the Bride kills later (in &#8220;real&#8221; chronological, not the movie&#8217;s narrative, order) they are both just caricatures of brainless hormones, Bad People. Or are we not supposed to read them that way? Are they just pitiful exaggerations of particularly sex-starved &#8220;normal&#8221; guys, albeit hideous and filthy ones?</p>
<p>The reason I called this depiction cowardly is because it&#8217;s easy. I mean, if they&#8217;d been black rather than white, it might have raised an outcry about the perils of racial stereotyping. However audiences just rolled with this characterization, laughing a bit in the audience I sat with. What makes this crime different from the others in the movie is that while most of the people in the audience haven&#8217;t executed an entire wedding party or disemboweled a man at a bar, a fair portion of what I presume is the target audience has (or knows someone who has) had sex with someone who wasn&#8217;t entirely awake or sober or otherwise consenting. To have the characters in the movie who do this be vapid idiots seems to me to allow viewers not to have any thoughts that might indict them or the sorts of things they believe in, since there is no entry for identification with these characters.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Tarantino has any responsibility to advance my political views, and I&#8217;m not surprised he doesn&#8217;t seem do so. I was just troubled by this in the context all the violence toward and between woman, and the audience reactions to all of it. I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;m asking for, which is why I&#8217;ve come to different views of the scene, but it was upsetting to me basically because it doesn&#8217;t humanize a very human issue and because it lets stupid guys (and I&#8217;m stereotyping on gender and many other grounds, I know) go on being stupid guys when there was a clear chance to challenge them. I shouldn&#8217;t be looking for verisimilitude in a movie like this, but it&#8217;s there to some extent, in a chilling and emotionally compelling scene, and yet it could have been so much more and, for me, made the movie so much less.</p>

<p>Hi, I&#8217;m writing my dissertation on KILL BILL and was researching the net when I found your page. Your argument is extremely clever, as I had never considered the rape scene in any other terms than the horny-idiots scene. I can see how you may feel let down by Tarantino - and I agree he is guilty of being irresponsible. Good luck. Claire xxx
