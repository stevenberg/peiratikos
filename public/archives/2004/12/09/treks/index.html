<div class="text">
<p>I know I said I&#8217;d be writing something substantive soon, but indulge me for another post (or maybe a few). <cite class="People">Steven</cite> and I watched <cite class="Movies">Trekkies</cite> last night, and it got me thinking about community and connectedness. And yes, this has a lot to do with seeing things through my currrent lens, but I understood the interviewees talking about how they&#8217;d met each other through <cite class="Television">Star Trek</cite> and the kinship they share in being fans and all that stuff. Right now I&#8217;m getting over being totally impressed by the kind, supportive comments off all sorts of people I&#8217;ve never talked to away from this screen as well as all the live people who&#8217;ve been part of my life or Steven&#8217;s and who wanted to be with us as kind, supportive witnesses to our public commitment, which is really the only thing making it different from the private relationship we&#8217;d had previously (and, I suppose, still).</p>
<p>Anyway, that was me apologizing for getting a bit misty-eyed about <cite>Trekkies</cite> and about the comics blogosphere. It&#8217;s really an exciting feeling to belong in just about any situation. In college, I ran a support group for survivors of sexual assault, and I think for most of us involved the most helpful, important thing we got from group discussions was the real understanding that we had shared emotional experiences, that I could talk about something that made me feel alienated and have someone say, &#8220;Oh, yeah, I understand and for me it&#8217;s like this&#8230;&#8221; I don&#8217;t think comics bloggers are a support group, but they serve that particular function of creating a kind of connectedness or re-norming.</p>
<p>Part of the reason I&#8217;m thinking about this, though, is that connectedness isn&#8217;t absolute, and it has its limits. In watching, I said to Steven of one Trekkie, &#8220;The cross-dressing doesn&#8217;t bother me at all, but I can&#8217;t handle the filk,&#8221; and I was being entirely honest. Some things are just beyond the pale, and while I can appreciate that people I like enjoy them, they seem laughably bad to me. I know others think the same of me, and I still appreciate not being lynched for being unimpressed and annoyed by <cite class="Comics">Eightball</cite> #23. I&#8217;ve always been interested in metablogging issues, and so it&#8217;s really fascinating to me to follow the different styles and approaches of the various comics bloggers, sometimes more than the blogs themselves. While it&#8217;s definitely fun that there are other bloggers writing analytically about mostly superhero comics &#8212; and more of them than when we began blogging here &#8212; I also read and enjoy reading writers whose aesthetic preferences have almost no overlap with mine. So while I feel a certain kind of kinship with other like-type bloggers and don&#8217;t always feel I quite fit in within the larger blogosphere (whatever that means) I get something out of all of it. And while I think I have more overlap with Steven than with anyone else probably ever, both of us appreciate having ppeople other than each other to talk to about these things we find intriguing.</p>
<p>But what I was really trying to get at in all that inanity is that I appreciate both the largely supportive culture and the lack of Geek Pride, which is way above filk in the list of things I dislike most. While plenty of the Trekkies seemed extreme in their dedication, they were all honest and at least a bit self-aware about their placement on the outskirts of the larger culture, whether they thought this was acceptable or not, versus their acceptance among other fans. What they largely avoided was the strange martyr complex I&#8217;ve found elsewhere, and which I haven&#8217;t noticed in comics blogging. There are geeks, and in my experience they&#8217;ve all been white men who publicly claim to be straight, and they make a lot of claims about being oppressed minorities. They say that geeks are the last acceptable stereotype (and &#8220;<em>x</em> is the last taboo&#8221; is also high on my hate list) and that they&#8217;re outcasts in society and that they need to reclaim the power that is rightfully theirs by somehow overturning the jocks, who will somehow recognize the error of their cruel ways. Or something like that.  Since I&#8217;m a woman, I also get to hear the corollary that geek-friendly women have some kind of moral obligation to have sex with these men, since part of the curse of being a geek is that it&#8217;s hard to get a date by more standard routes. And all of this manifests itself in a whole lot of whining, not to mention complaining about other groups who supposedly benefit from affirmative action or feminism (or, uh, laws banning them from marrying their chosen partners, which is probably not the sort of thing that gets facttored in) and how it&#8217;s ok to be different in those ways, but that being a geek is both a choice and a calling and thus somehow nobler than more standard, intrinsic disenfranchisement.  Yes, I&#8217;m whining about whiners, but I&#8217;m getting it out of my system so you won&#8217;t have to hear about it again.</p>
<p>And the point, as I keep claiming I&#8217;ll tell you, is that I really, really appreciate not having to hear that much if at all anymore. I like this current life in which I&#8217;m not supposed to be a judge at a Losers Contest. I&#8217;m glad to watch a show about people who idolize a show I&#8217;ve never seen, and it makes me think of me and of you poor readers, and all of us who are making tenuous connections and finding ways to make them stick and managing to build places for ourselves. I didn&#8217;t start blogging looking for affirmation, but because I&#8217;d been so depressed and troubled that I was almost physically unable to write, and so it waas painful practice, and also because Steven and I were far apart and wanted to be together and talking. And while it&#8217;s still really about us and what we find interesting and the ways our conversations with each other can be translated onto a bigger scale, I&#8217;m now very much in conversation with other bloggers and with non-bloggers who comment and even with a few brave friends of mine who don&#8217;t even read comics and yet have probably read every word of the post to this point because they care about me. And while in some sense I don&#8217;t care who cares about me, I care that I care and that there are these connections being forged and that in a year or so of blogging I&#8217;ve become someone who can write more easily, if not yet with total comfort, and can sometimes even be proud of what I&#8217;ve written. But I&#8217;m also proud that those who respond find meaning (or problems) in what I say, just as I&#8217;m proud of bloggers I read who are saying good, smart things even if they have no idea who I am or that I read their words. And I&#8217;m pretty sure this is my most self-indulgent post ever, so I appreciate that I expect to be forgiven my temporary lapse, which can be blamed in part on long-term lack of sleep I&#8217;m going to try to rectify a bit now. Thanksgiving seems to be coming to me late this year, but I assure you it&#8217;s entirely heartfelt. Now live long and prosper.</p>

<p>Wow. You pretty much summed up the comics blogging community pretty well. I thought I was actually going to get a little choked up towards the end. :) You and Steven deserve my thanks for being there as well. As I&#8217;ve said before your blog always makes me think, sometimes it&#8217;s about things that weren&#8217;t really intended by the initial post, but it makes me think none the less. That&#8217;s a compliment.

<p>This is a really good post; really, Rose, you have a knack for writing things that very nicely encapsulate things I keep meaning to write about, thus sparing the world more of my blather.  The community aspect of blogging was not something I was expecting when I started&#8211;and it&#8217;s turned out to the aspect of the experience I value the most.  Go figure.

<p>Oh yeah speaking of comic books do you think you might review Amazing Joy Buzzards on your blog when it comes out?  </p>

<p>Shane &#038; Dave, thanks for the kind words. I think a lot about the community aspects of blogging, and this is not quite how I thought I&#8217;d end up talking about it. I&#8217;m glad what I said made sense and got through.</p>
<p>Mark, we don&#8217;t do reviews here, but most other comics bloggers do. I know I&#8217;d be more inclined to read a book if the author emailed me rather than just leaving a comment, but that&#8217;s because I&#8217;m a weirdo control freak. But the point is that we talk about comics and reading, but probably not in a way that would be useful for anyone interested in self-promotion.
