<div class="text">
<p><cite class="People">Marc Singer</cite> has this to say about the <a href="http://www.whiterose.org/howlingcurmudgeons/archives/006054.html">common overuse of the term &#8220;backlash&#8221;</a> in the comics blogosphere:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.whiterose.org/howlingcurmudgeons/archives/006054.html"><p>&#8220;Criticism&#8221; does not equal &#8220;backlash,&#8221; or &#8220;snobbery&#8221; for that matter (as you should damn well know, Abhay). [&#8230;] Do we really need to hear those disclaimers now? Or is the problem that this time the object of scorn is a fan darling, not one of those eminently safe targets like Liefeld?</p></blockquote>
<p>Marc is replying to a commenter who pinned the word &#8220;backlash&#8221; on Marc&#8217;s critique of <cite class="People">Brian Michael Bendis</cite> and <cite class="People">Alex Maleev</cite>&#8217;s work on <cite class="Comics">Daredevil</cite>, but the above quote applies equally well to <cite class="People">Sean Collins</cite>&#8217;s use of the word in his <a href="http://alltooflat.com/about/personal/sean/?BlogNum=872">round up of recent discussion</a> on, among other topics, <cite class="Comics">Eightball</cite> #23. Now, I&#8217;m sure Sean means well, but he has a habit of crying &#8220;backlash&#8221; every time somebody expresses a less than entirely positive opinion concerning something Sean likes a lot (e.g., <cite class="Comics">Blankets</cite>). The problem is, &#8220;backlash&#8221; usually carries a connotation (whether it&#8217;s intended or not) that the backlashers are antagonizing or attempting to punish the targets of backlash for pushing too far in a direction the backlashers don&#8217;t care for. Merely offering negative critique of some popular and well-liked work isn&#8217;t really backlash, but attacking those who like some popular and well-liked work&#8212;whether directly, or indirectly through a critique of the work&#8212;certainly is. It&#8217;s true that <cite class="People">Steve Pheley</cite> begins his <a href="http://gutterninja.blogspot.com/2004/07/oh-like-i-had-any-indy-street-cred-to.html">review of <cite>Eightball</cite></a> by writing, &#8220;Really, I don&#8217;t understand what the fuss is about,&#8221; but questioning the outright absurd mania with which, e.g., <cite class="People">Alan David Doane</cite> <a href="http://comicbookgalaxy.com/071404review.html">reviews <cite>Eightball</cite></a> should hardly be lumped in with &#8220;&#8216;Dan Clowes has no clothes&#8217; backlash,&#8221; particularly considering Steve goes on to suggest he rather enjoyed the book. (And after all, Alan&#8217;s review contains entire sentences typed in all-caps and bizarre ranting about Dan Clowes&#8217;s &#8220;arctic shit-knife.&#8221; He&#8217;s sort of asking for people to giggle at him, really.)</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m getting at here is, if I never see another comics blogger use the word &#8220;backlash&#8221; again in my life, I will be <em>so</em> happy.</p>
<p>(By the way, I was actually expecting Sean to pull out his trusty &#8220;backlash&#8221; stamp for my own review of <cite>Eightball</cite>. I didn&#8217;t ask what all the fuss is about in my review, but it&#8217;s what I was thinking as I wrote. I mean, as I implied at the end of my review, I&#8217;ve read or am aware of so many stories [usually but not always written by white American males] about &#8220;I&#8217;m a horrible monster because of my repressed homoerotic urges that I can&#8217;t get over&#8221; [although the homoeroticism is usually annoyingly coy and subtextual, as in &#8220;The Death-Ray&#8221;], and come on Dan Clowes, we had to read this same story a million times in high-school English [not that our teachers were ever willing to admit they were forcing us to read practically nothing but stories about subtextual homosexuality], it&#8217;s time to write something new. I mean, I&#8217;m sure Clowes really felt like he had to write this story, but why do there have to be so many <em>American male writers</em> who have to write this same story? If there&#8217;s a &#8220;&#8216;Dan Clowes has no clothes&#8217; backlash,&#8221; I&#8217;m probably part of it. Although I think he probably does have clothes, it&#8217;s just that maybe he should try on some different clothes, to strain the metaphor.)</p>
<p>(By the way again, see <cite class="People">Ken Lowery</cite> for hilarious &#8220;backlash&#8221; [<a href="http://ringwood.blogspot.com/2004_07_11_ringwood_archive.html#109009868731621020">1</a>, <a href="http://ringwood.blogspot.com/2004_07_18_ringwood_archive.html#109019737559116052">2</a>].)

Thanks for the link. I remember reading your post back in March, but I&#8217;d forgotten about it. You&#8217;ve got a clearer definition of backlash there than I came up with.

<p>J.W.,<br />
I remember enjoying your breakdown of backlash, too, but it still seems that what you&#8217;re talking about there is still very different from Sean&#8217;s idea that it&#8217;s backlash if you take into account critical responses rather than discussing The Work, Period. I don&#8217;t really understand his position, particularly when he&#8217;s making it in a post in which he gathers running commentary on others&#8217; impressions of the work in question, but I&#8217;m very troubled by the idea that holding other people accountable for their blog shenanigans or critical opinions is a <i>bad</i> thing. I imagine I could do a perfectly good reading of ADD&#8217;s original post and that this would be every bit as meaningful a blog post as one about <cite>Eightball</cite> #23, but just different. It&#8217;s a question of what constitutes the work.  But now I&#8217;m just ranting, I think.

<p>I&#8217;m not sure I buy Sean&#8217;s subsequent explanation that his use of &#8220;backlash&#8221; referred only to posts critical of the hype and not the comic, given that he did start off Round 2 with the line &#8220;We&#8217;re beginning to see a &#8216;Dan Clowes has no clothes&#8217; backlash&#8221; rather than something like &#8220;We&#8217;re beginning to see an &#8216;Alan David Doane needs a Valium&#8217; backlash.&#8221;</p>
<p>This comment really belongs on Sean&#8217;s blog, but as he doesn&#8217;t have comments I&#8217;ll just place it here and add my vocal agreement to Steven&#8217;s exhaustion re: the use of &#8220;backlash&#8221; any time a fan darling takes a well-deserved hit.

<p>This doesn&#8217;t have anything specifically to do with what Sean was talking about, but I have noticed that almost every time Dan Clowes releases something new, someone, somewhere, takes a shot at it.  I did this when the first &#8220;David Boring&#8221; issue came out, and had to eat my words once I had read the entire story.  And, like my initial critique of DB, most of these pieces feel like they&#8217;d been written beforehand, with just enough details tossed in to keep it up to date.  (Steven&#8217;s analysis of EB23 certainly didn&#8217;t feel at all like this, but I can&#8217;t say the same for other negative responses I&#8217;ve read.)</p>
<p>However, this has gotten me thinking about some of the dangers of the 24-hour reviewing cycle.  I know that my own first impressions of certain works have changed (sometimes radically) as I&#8217;ve had a chance to think more about them. Dueling first impressions can be fun, but it seems to early for Sean to draw a line in the sand over the issue.</p>

<p>Btw, I think J.W.&#8217;s piece on backlash is quite apt - the section on &#8220;Must See TV&#8221; alone could be a summary of the <i>Eightball</i> reaction with the serial numbers filed off.
