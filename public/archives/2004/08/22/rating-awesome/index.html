<div class="text">
<p>I was going to start this post by asserting that I haven&#8217;t followed more illustrious bloggers into hiatus because I had gotten tired of writing, but only because of a total lack of time, not to mention technology meltdowns that have been resolved at least in the past week. But then I realized that there is even more too it than that. Basically since the beginning of the Peiratikos blog, my interest in comics has been waning. Occasionally there&#8217;s a <cite class="Comics">Seaguy</cite> to perk me up, but I mostly stick with it because I like talking with <cite class="People">Steven</cite> about things we&#8217;ve both read and because I enjoy some of my fellow writers in the blogosphere and because it&#8217;s good practice to be writing.  But I was uninspired and missing blogging only in that I felt some guilt about not keeping up with it. Then last week I got some sort of flu and was stuck in bed and ended up reading something that changed all of that. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, reading <a href="http://www.scottpilgrim.com/"><cite class="Comics">Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s Precious Little Life</cite></a> by <cite class="People">Bryan O&#8217;Malley</cite> was something of a conversion experience.</p>
<p>I agree with <a href="https://peiratikos.net/archives/2004/08/17/scott-pilgrim/">Steven</a> about the contents of the book, though I don&#8217;t necessarily endorse quoting of <cite class="People">Foreigner</cite> lyrics. Scott is a relentlessly self-absorbed 23-year-old Romantic musician in a nonsexual relationship with 17-year-old Chinese-Canadian Knives Chau who forsakes her (kinda) for the literal girl of his dreams, super-cool American rollerblading delivery girl Ramona Flowers. But there&#8217;s more to it than that. For one thing, the art is amazingly cute,  unique manga-ish flatly layered yet static black-and-white scenes. It&#8217;s cute, very cute. I know I said that already, but I emphasize because I might have avoided it for fear of cuteness had Steven not pushed for it, because I&#8217;m afraid that cute stories can&#8217;t live up to my cuteness standards, whereas ugly stories tend to be fine at staying ugly. But what&#8217;s more impressive is that Scott is such a likable hero even while his faults are all totally evident. It&#8217;s clear why his bandmates are charmed with Scott (and also why Kim can see through him) and why his roommate Wallace tolerates his general helplessness. He&#8217;s endearingly self-assured, unquestioningly sure that he&#8217;s the hero of his own narrative. </p>
<p>So there I was, 24 and not in a band but soaking in the bath, trying to open my sinuses, feeling frumpy and unfriendly, and Scott Pilgrim managed to get through anyway. I don&#8217;t know what more to say than that it was charmingly written, with a feel of both real affection and real communication that is rare in comics. <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite> made me wonder what ever became of all the bands I hung out with back in high school, when I was a high-strung non-physical Catholic school girl not unlike Knives. I assume many of them think of themselves in the same inflated terms Scott Pilgrim would use to assess his own life, but somehow this is much easier to tolerate in a fictional character than it would be in my old circle of friends if we hadn&#8217;t all drifted in our own directions. The funniest line is not, as Steven erroneously believes, Scott&#8217;s lack of knowledge about <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/">amazon.ca</a>&#8217;s web address, but that when major characters get ratings (whether as to hotness or just general goodness is unclear) Scott&#8217;s 19-year-old sister is rated &#8220;&#8216;T&#8217; for Teen.&#8221;</p>
<p>And obviously I successfully coerced Steven into reading <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite>, meaning that I got an email on my first day back to work saying &#8220;Not only is everything grammatical and spelled correctly, it&#8217;s intelligent, witty, pomo playful.&#8221; That first part is almost the most essential in my book, as I think everyone is right to refuse to take comics seriously as long as comics writers (/artists/letterers) are unwilling to write properly and get their writing edited before going to press.  (Most recently, this meant fury at <cite class="People">Peter David</cite> or whichever <cite class="Comics">Captain Marvel</cite> staffer couldn&#8217;t bother to do a quick search to realize that <cite class="People">Anne Heche</cite> is an Anne-with-an-E. Seriously, people, this is the easiest stuff ever, and it makes you look like morons and makes me despise you. Trust me on this.) At any rate, <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite> is seriously well-written, funny and poignant and self-aware, smart without being at all pretentious, full of goofy banalities without being stupid. It was a little depressing to see how young Bryan Lee O&#8217;Malley is, but I&#8217;m ok with the idea that I&#8217;m not going to accomplish much, so it&#8217;s not a competition. At any rate, he&#8217;s clearly very talented, an excellent storyteller with a good ear for dialogue and an eye for the details that matter. I look forward to seeing the next installment of Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s life (and we have to wait &#8217;til <em>2005</em>??) and whatever else he&#8217;ll be creating after.

<p>I read Scott Pilgrim this weekend, after hitting up three stores before finding a copy (in fairness, at least one of those stores didn&#8217;t have it because they had sold out). I can&#8217;t even begin to express how impressed I was. O&#8217;Malley has grown by leaps and bounds since Lost at Sea, which I&#8217;d rate a solid &#8220;ok&#8221; and is the reason I didn&#8217;t pre-order Scott Pilgrim. What a great book!

<p>Like many other things, <cite>Lost at Sea</cite> slipped below my radar, perhaps because I wasn&#8217;t really buying comics when it came out. So Steven and I raced around to all our local comics stores looking for it, with no luck. I&#8217;m glad the word about <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite> is getting out, though, because I adore it. And we all know everyone should read the things I like!
