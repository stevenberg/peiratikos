<div class="text">
<p>So I&#8217;m definitely not back to regular blogging&#8212;OK, I&#8217;ve never managed to blog very regularly, but anyway, I&#8217;m definitely not prepared even for monthly blogging at this point. We&#8217;ll have to see how it goes when my semester ends in a couple weeks. In the meantime, I&#8217;ve decided to join the world of <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html">Web 2.0</a> and start participating in <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/steven-berg/">Flickr</a> (see also <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/rose-and-steven/">the <strong>rose and steven</strong> group</a>) and <a href="http://del.icio.us/steven.berg">del.icio.us</a>. So far I&#8217;ve only uploaded <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/steven-berg/sets/72057594109610194/">the photos from our trip to New Orleans</a> and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/steven-berg/sets/72057594110994714/">many photos of our pet cat</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>As long as I&#8217;m writing, I might as well write a little more. I think the only movie other than <a href="../03/02/ummmm"><cite class="Movies">Brokeback Mountain</cite></a> that Rose and I have seen in a theater this year is <cite class="Movies">V for Vendetta</cite>. Oh, no, we also saw <cite class="Movies">Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story</cite>. I need to read <cite class="People">Laurence Sterne</cite>&#8217;s novel so I can understand how it works as an adaptation, but it works well standing alone too. As far as this kind of movie goes, I think it&#8217;s more frivolous than <cite class="Movies">8Â½</cite> and probably less frivolous than <cite class="Movies">Adaptation</cite>.</p>
<p>But <cite>V for Vendetta</cite>. We weren&#8217;t initially planning to see it, because it looked pretty stupid. But <a href="http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/2006_03_01_archive.asp#114258572436494811"><cite class="People">William Gibson</cite> recommended it</a> and <a href="http://sweet-nothing.livejournal.com/"><cite class="People">John Pistelli</cite> at Maxims and Reflections</a> had a whole series of entertaining posts (<a href="http://sweet-nothing.livejournal.com/2842.html">&#8220;Ideas are Bulletproof,&#8221;</a> <a href="http://sweet-nothing.livejournal.com/3113.html">&#8220;Re-review,&#8221;</a> <a href="http://sweet-nothing.livejournal.com/3367.html">&#8220;Brands are Ideaproof,&#8221;</a> <a href="http://sweet-nothing.livejournal.com/4479.html">&#8220;A Shamanic Soldier Priest&#8221;</a> [tangentially related]) that really made me want to see the movie. So I did. Twice, in fact: once on my own because Rose was otherwise occupied and then again with Rose. I think <cite class="People">Alan Moore</cite>&#8217;s book doesn&#8217;t translate well to cinema&#8212;it might have worked better as a much longer movie or a miniseries. It needs an ensemble cast and time to develop several protagonists. The movie jettisons pretty much everything from the book except V&#8217;s story and follows a more conventional heroic adventure format that misses much of the book&#8217;s political sophistication. I guess Evey&#8217;s story is largely intact, especially her imprisonment, but it suffers in comparison with Evey&#8217;s story in the book. Movie Evey is older than Book Evey, and this allows her to be less dependent on V. But the filmmakers replace Book V and Book Evey&#8217;s coercive power-imbalanced relationship with a more conventional romantic subplot that appears unexpectedly and arbitrarily near the end of the movie. (I certainly wasn&#8217;t expecting that kiss, anyway.) I prefer the movie&#8217;s less Stockholm Syndrome-esque version of Evey&#8217;s escape from prison, but I prefer the book&#8217;s less sentimental version of Evey&#8217;s final crisis and climax after V&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>Other <cite class="Comics">V for Vendetta</cite> thoughts, maybe for writing about in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>The prologue and epilogue with Evey admonishing the viewer that the man is more important than the man&#8217;s ideas: why do the filmmakers undermine V&#8217;s claim that ideas are bulletproof?</li>
<li>The surprising prosperity and invisibility of class and poverty in this fascist dystopia which lost at least several tens of thousands people from its population to plague and genocide, in a world where the U.S.A. has disintegrated into civil war and the Middle East has presumably done the same or been destroyed entirely. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s U.S. culture&#8217;s typical blindness to economic inequality&#8212;everybody&#8217;s middle class in TV land&#8212;but it seems especially egregious in such a political polemical movie.</li>

<div class="text">
<p>Not such an exciting month, but the first to feature audio books since two interstate trips necessitated something to help me keep my eyes on the road.</p>
<p><cite class="Books">The Partly Cloudy Patriot</cite>, <cite class="People">Sarah Vowell</cite>, read by the author and famous pals<br />
I know everyone thinks Sarah Vowell&#8217;s voice is the hottest thing ever, but it definitely took some time to grow on me, though grow it did to some degree. I like the authorial intent side of hearing a writer read her own work, but it can be unsettling too. I don&#8217;t want to know that Vowell says &#8220;R. E.&#8221; for &#8220;Re:&#8221; any more than I wanted to know that <cite class="People">William Gibson</cite> says &#8220;ock-TAYVE&#8221; or pronounces &#8220;Jean&#8221; the same way whether it refers to a boy or a girl. Though since I&#8217;m a heretic and hadn&#8217;t read much of Sarah Vowell&#8217;s writing anyway, it won&#8217;t hurt me much to hear her voice subvocalizing next time I come to it. I&#8217;m still on the lookout for the audio version of <cite class="Books">Assassination Vacation</cite>, at least part of which should be perfect preparation for another trip to Buffalo.</p>
<p><cite class="Books">Where Girls Come First: The Rise, Fall, and Surprising Revival of Girls&#8217; Schools</cite>, <cite class="People">Ilana DeBare</cite><br />
I went to an all-girls high school, although the Catholic sort that only warrants a chapter here, so I have strong feelings about the potentials for success in all-female environments. DeBare, in working to found a non-religious independent and progressive school for girls, began researching the history of girls&#8217; schools and realized there was a lot more of that independent mindset in the schools that had come before her than many people would assume. There&#8217;s not a lot of depth here, but it covers a lot of ground and I found it entertaining and interesting reading. I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about education recently and reading a lot of parent blogs and educator blogs where such things are discussed. I sure am glad to be able to think about this more as theory than practice.</p>
<p><cite class="Books">Stiffs: The Curious Life of Human Cadavers</cite>, <cite class="People">Mary Roach</cite>, read by <cite class="People">Shelly Frasier</cite><br />
As a road book, this was more than tolerable, though I found the reading boring. It&#8217;s painful to listen to a slow reader and I keep wanting to push ahead to a comfortable pace the way I would if I were in control. Also I was horrified that they didn&#8217;t get someone who knew the difference between &#8220;cavalry&#8221; and &#8220;Calvary&#8221; or how to pronounce &#8220;Turin&#8221; since that kept cropping up. I&#8217;m still not sold on audio books mostly because I prefer to read idiosyncratically, but this was an engaging enough book that made the miles and miles of Ohio pass more pleasantly.</p>
<p><cite class="Books">The Telling</cite>, <cite class="People">Ursula Le Guin</cite><br />
<a href="../02/28/the-telling">Indeed, I reread it</a>. Still beautiful and haunting and true.</p>
<p><cite class="Books">Confessions of a Cineplex Heckler: Celluloid Tirades and Escapades</cite>, <cite class="People">Joe Queenan</cite><br />
I got this because it was cheap, knowing nothing about it. Queenan has a collection of anecdotes about movies he&#8217;s seen and reviewed, the sort of thing that nowadays you&#8217;d find on a blog. I don&#8217;t know if he and I share a ton of common ground in terms of aesthetic preferences (except a mutual dislike for the near-mandatory scenes where some guy gets kicked in the crotch) but I decided to not really argue with anything and just see how much entertainment I could get out of it, which was enough for the tiny amount of time it took to work my way through each article.</p>
<p><cite class="Books">Holidays on Ice</cite>, <cite class="People">David Sedaris</cite>, read by the author<br />
Another car trip. Maybe this shouldn&#8217;t count because I had Steven shut off the cd with the one about the tv producer at the Southern church, especially because I didn&#8217;t want to hear that horrible Christmas letter. But I&#8217;ve read the book before, which is how I knew what to skip. I&#8217;d wanted to actually hear The SantaLand Diaries and that was worth it, but ooooooh does the fictiony fiction hurt.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m reading other books but I didn&#8217;t finish any of them. I was aiming for a lot of non-fiction this time around but only managed a little bit, or perhaps lots of little bits.

<p><strong>Edited to change &#8220;Space Opera&#8221; to &#8220;Space Odyssey&#8221; because my error was annoying me.</strong></p>
<p>I do have a pitifully short list of books I read during March as well as all sorts of thoughts about how much I loved (and love and aim to keep loving) <cite class="Comics">Gray Horses</cite>. Then there&#8217;s more about weird relationship issues in other books, but mostly it&#8217;s spring and I&#8217;m lazy and tired and overworked and this is what you get from me today.</p>
<p>Instead what you get is (BUM BUM BUM)</p>
<div class="img calign"><img src='https://peiratikos.net/wp/wp-content/images/2001.jpg' alt='Saffron reacts to the movie.' width="300" height="225" /></div>
<p>our cat&#8217;s first year of participation in <a href="http://milogeorge.blogspot.com/2005/04/happy-international-record-your-cat.html">International Record Your Cat Reacting to <cite class="Movies">2001: A Space Odyssey</cite> Day</a>, although given her age it&#8217;s also her first year of eligibility. </p>
<p>Saffron is decidedly not a fan. The music creeped her out and she wouldn&#8217;t go near the screen unless, as in the photo, <cite class="People">Steven</cite> forced her to look while I snapped a photo. She seems to have recovered well and is sleeping happily on my feet now, so at least this story has a happy and easily comprehensible ending.
