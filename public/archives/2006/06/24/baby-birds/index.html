<div class="text">
<p>It was almost a week ago while I was traveling that I got an email from <cite class="People">Steven</cite> saying that he&#8217;d found a baby bird dying in the hallway of our apartment. I thought that was really odd, but was just glad the cat hadn&#8217;t hastened its end. Then came my triumphant return and my day off work Wednesday and a whole lot of bird sounds. I went into the bedroom to find the cat entranced with the closet and quite a racket coming from within. </p>
<p>I was terrified for the bird, but managed to trap it in a shoebox and get it out to the balcony. It was weak, frail, featherless in spots. Its parents flew around but didn&#8217;t come near. It got out of the box and, terrified, threw itself off the edge of the balcony. While I don&#8217;t think it would have survived long anyway, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brododaktula/172070364/">it died soon after its fall</a> and I buried it <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brododaktula/172261027/">on the back hill</a>. I cried a lot.</p>
<p>Clearly something was going wrong to let birds into our apartment, and since they were in the closet I suspected the problem was connected to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brododaktula/172070433/">the air conditioning unit there</a>. There is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brododaktula/172260999/">a nest</a> above and to the right of our air conditioning unit&#8217;s vent to the outside, but I think the actual connection must happen inside the brick, which explains the insulation that floats down to our closet floor. </p>
<p>Ever since then, it&#8217;s been like &#8220;The Tell-Tale Heart.&#8221; I wake in the middle of the night sure that somewhere I can hear a bird, an indoor bird, a dying bird. Today I had that same dreadful certainty but whenever I went to the closet, any chirping stopped. After vacuuming out all the insulation and clearing carpet space for birds to fall, I climbed up to see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brododaktula/173794323/">the hole that must be the way in</a>. </p>
<p>Being sure in my heart that the birdsongs I heard were the equivalent of the call coming from inside the house, I finally had to set up a stakeout. I sat with my laptop for a while and, as I&#8217;d feared, there was a shrill sound from a box I&#8217;d moved out of the way in my cleaning. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brododaktula/173938946/">This one</a> had feathers and personality, and could get itself off the ground a few inches when it flapped its wings. I kept it on the balcony until I was sure the parents had found it and watched them fly to the edge of the box, chirping wildly. When I released the fledgling <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brododaktula/174075798/">into the bush below its nest</a>, I couldn&#8217;t hear any more cheeping babies in the nest. I did see both parents as I walked back to the apartment.</p>
<p>It makes me feel like a freak that little birds have driven me to photo(blogo)journalism, but I wanted to have documents for when they weren&#8217;t there anymore. Maybe it&#8217;s because everything seemed like an emergency, like time was slipping away, but I wanted something that would remind me I&#8217;d done something (even if, since it&#8217;s a photo, that something was only look) and I think it worked. I can hear birds outside now and they sound plenty cheerful to me, but what do I know about birds?
