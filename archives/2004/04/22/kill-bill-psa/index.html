<div class="text">
<p>Every time somebody <a href="http://www.alltooflat.com/about/personal/sean/?BlogNum=773">says something like this</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.alltooflat.com/about/personal/sean/?BlogNum=773"><p>It&#8217;s really for the best if you ignore the people who didn&#8217;t like Kill Bill Volumes One and Two, which taken together comprise one of the best movies I&#8217;ve ever seen. </p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s really for the best if you ignore them! <cite class="People">Sean Collins</cite> said that. Why, I can&#8217;t imagine. Maybe he&#8217;s joking, but he mostly just sounds indignant. I guess he thinks only people who agree with him are worth paying attention to. How boring.</p>
<p>He also says:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.alltooflat.com/about/personal/sean/?BlogNum=773"><p>I do, however, wish I knew how people can watch a movie in which bad behavior occurs and, because they find the film amusing on some level, deduce that that bad behavior is being endorsed&#8211;particularly in an oeuvre like Tarantino&#8217;s, in which characters who refuse to renounce violence and deceit are inevitably punished for that refusal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I personally didn&#8217;t find the &#8220;bad behavior&#8221; (I guess that would include raping a comatose woman, as well as the comotase woman eating off her rapist&#8217;s face, both pretty bad behavior) amusing, and I didn&#8217;t think the bad behavior was endorsed, so that&#8217;s fine. Actually, scratch that, a lot of the <em>Bride&#8217;s</em> bad behavior was most certainly endorsed, or at least <em>looked upon with some approval</em> by Tarantino&#8212;<a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/04/20/kill-bill-foundations-audience/">and members of the audience</a>. Actually, the way Sean puts it here, which isn&#8217;t really a way I&#8217;d thought about it before, makes the movie seem way more fucked up than I thought at first&#8212;it gives us violent setpieces which are filmed in such a way as to entertain and exhilarate us, and then it says &#8220;Oh, but this violent which is so exciting and fun to watch is bad! These characters must be punished!&#8221;</p>
<p>I wish I knew why <cite class="People">Quentin Tarantino</cite> and people in the audience Rose and I watched it with find this movie so amusing.</p>
<p>Oh, and pointing out other movies that immorally play gratuitous violence for laughs doesn&#8217;t exactly absolve <cite>Kill Bill</cite>&#8230; or maybe Tarantino does it <em>morally</em>?</p>
<p>And really, I came out of the theater thinking <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill Vol. 2</cite> was much better than <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill Vol. 1</cite>, which I sort of liked but had lots of problems with, and I thought &#8220;Hey, get rid of that stupid Buck chapter and <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill</cite> works pretty well,&#8221; but it&#8217;s such a frustrating movie, and I can&#8217;t figure out if it&#8217;s good frustrating or bad frustrating. I fear it&#8217;s both, and I fear Tarantino didn&#8217;t think it was supposed to be frustrating at all.</p>
<p>I do hope we get to hear why <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill</cite> is one of the best movies Sean has ever seen. And Sean, I am curious, given your outspoken views on feminism and misogyny in movies like <cite class="Movies">Dogville</cite>, to hear your thoughts on the issue of sexual and sexually violent exploitation of women characters for entertainment.

<p>I had <a href="http://www.forager23.com/archives/000268.html">a similar reaction to Sean&#8217;s post</a>.</p>
<p>I think Tarantino makes &#8220;autistic&#8221; movies.  He has talent, but the scenes in his movies to refer to anything besides scenes in other movies.  I think the audiences who respond positively to his movies get this, that is, they don&#8217;t take any of it seriously.  Unfortunately, Tarantino and his supporters seem to want us to take it seriously.  That&#8217;s why it can be so frustrating: the fun of watching a cool fight scene is ruined by the movie&#8217;s insistence of its own importance.  And when you look at the substance of what the movie has to say it gets pretty ugly.</p>

<p>My oh my this Kill Bill discussion is getting pretty tricky!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in a weird place with the movie(s)&#8230; I enjoyed them hugely on a purely stylistic level &#8211; it looked great, and while I didn&#8217;t get half of the references, I enjoyed the magpie aesthetic &#8211; but yeah, these movies are pretty damned weird thematically. </p>
<p>Basically, I think I&#8217;m saying that I enjoyed Kill Bill Vols 1 &#038; 2 in pretty much the way that J.W. describes in his above post, but not to the degree that I can entirely block out the more troubling aspects of the stories (especially in the light of the oddness that was volume 2).</p>
<p>I feel especially weird commenting here because I thought Kill Bill was pretty damned funny in places&#8230; Vol 1 more so than Vol 2. It was the staging that I found amusing &#8211; the sheer OTT absurdity of it all was pretty &#8220;cartoony&#8221;, and was often done with what seemed to me to be a good sense of comic timing. However, there is much in the two movies to make me feel uncomfortable with this/come out of the detatched viewing mode I was in most of the time. The Buck stuff isn Vol 1 was very unsettling, yes, and pretty much most of the violence in Vol 2 had this effect on me also (perhaps because most of the violence in Vol 1, the opening fight excluded, either took place in an anime flashback or featured a huge number of opponents while the violence in Vol 2 was much more constantly &#8220;personal&#8221;, it seemed to me). </p>
<p>I dunno&#8230; the violence in these movies is very weirdly handled. It&#8217;s hugely stylised and rediculous, but yet there&#8217;s always this emphasis on the sheer&#8230; physicality of the violence that sits oddly with this.</p>
<p>Heh - as I think is probably becoming very obvious, I&#8217;m not sure exactly what I think about Kill Bill.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&#8217;ve got the flu and am rambling, so I&#8217;ll shut up now. </p>
<p>Glad you two, J.W. Hastings and everyone else are analyising the movies though &#8211; it&#8217;s making for some interesting reading!    </p>

<p class="commentmeta">Steven says:</p>
<div class="text">
<p>I found parts of <cite>Kill Bill</cite> funny too. And it did look good, and I can appreciate many individual images, scenes and stylistic flourishes, but I want aesthetic structure too! And it&#8217;s elusive, if not entirely absent. So yeah, I&#8217;m not sure what to think of the movie either, although I&#8217;m leaning toward &#8220;Tarantino is a fine stylist but forgot about aesthetics.&#8221;
