<p><b><a href="http://www.slavelabor.com/index2.html"><cite class="Comics">Street Angel</cite></a> in &#8220;INCAdinkaDOOM&#8221; and &#8220;Going Street to Hell&#8221;<br />
<cite class="People">Jim Rugg</cite> and <cite class="People">Brian Maruca</cite></b></p>
<p>Call me a curmudgeon, but I didn&#8217;t much enjoy <cite>Street Angel</cite> #2. It&#8217;s amusing, but the humor slips too far into pointless silliness. It reads like a creative-writing class assignment gone awry: pull five unrelated plot elements out of a hat and write a story about them. Some of it works&#8212;the Incan sun god Inti sending Cortez and his men to modern Wilkesborough seems like a fine premise. The Irish astronaut Cosmick is fun (and his linguistic training to prepare him for contact with extraterrestrial life is the issue&#8217;s funniest joke), but he begs (in the text itself, even) to get his own story. In &#8220;INCAdinkaDOOM,&#8221; he only gets in the way. Inti&#8217;s Incan African hip-hop/gangsta business exectuive act is unfortunate and inexplicable. That Cortez and his men are pirates, complete with peg legs, pirate hates and &#8220;Yars!&#8221; is unfortunate and inexplicable&#8212;even moreso in juxtaposition with Gangsta Inti. I think I see the creative reasoning that must have gone into the piratical conquistadors: Ninjas feature centrally in &#8220;INCAdinkaDOOM,&#8221; and I believe they featured centrally in the first issue of <cite>Street Angel</cite>. Given an apparent necessity of ninjas in <cite>Street Girl</cite> and the Incans vs. Cortez vs. Street Girl premise of this issue, it makes sense (well, not really, but let&#8217;s say it does for the sake of my point) to have the Spaniards be pirates to exploit the ancient <a href="http://www.majcher.com/pvn/">pirate vs. ninja</a> vendetta. Everybodys knows, right, pirates are funny, and ninjas are funny, and pirates vs. ninjas is funniest? Well, it was funny for a couple minutes the first time I saw the joke on some web site. It&#8217;s conceptually funny, you can see how somebody might do a funny joke about pirates fighting ninjas. Rugg and Maruca make the mistake, too tragically common among humorists, of referencing a funny concept and relying on the conceptual funniness instead of working it into an actual joke that&#8217;s funny in practice. <cite class="People">Roger Ebert</cite> often says in his reviews of unsuccessful comedies that a character in a silly hat isn&#8217;t funny&#8212;but if the character doesn&#8217;t know she&#8217;s got a silly hat on, you have the potential for real humor. It&#8217;s a simplistic example, but the idea is sound: referencing a silly thing offers little entertainment until you place them in a situation that exploits it for a comic effect beyond the basic silliness. <cite>Street Angel</cite> says, &#8220;Look, pirates vs. ninjas&#8212;eh!&#8221; and the joke falls flat.</p>
<p>Incan African gangsta sun gods, jokes about the lack of female Incan virgins available for sacrifice, pirates, ninjas, Irish astronauts&#8212;maybe there&#8217;s some funny story to be told about all these themes together, but <cite>Street Angel</cite> simply piles one on top of the other senselessly. The whole is less than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going Street to Hell,&#8221; on the other hand, is lots of fun. The tone is different, darker and more ominous, but the core of the second issue&#8217;s sense of humor remains: Street Angel is dumped in the middle of a ridiculous supernatural battle and finds herself deeply  unimpressed with all involved. Actually, what&#8217;s different this issue isn&#8217;t that the tone is darker, but that it has a tone at all&#8212;issue #2 had too much disconnected randomness from one moment to the next ever to develop one clearly. In issue #3, Rugg and Maruca confine themselves to one coherent and sensical premise&#8212;Christians vs. Satanists&#8212;which allows them to develop jokes that complement each other rather than distract from each other. Throwaway gags (including the valiant Bald Eagle, who becomes a literal throwaway gag) grow and send roots into the meaty heart of the story. Bald Eagle&#8217;s nightmare of soccer-playing sharks is as nonsensical as anything in issue #2, but it connects to the skewed Christian themes in &#8220;Going Street to Hell&#8221; and feeds on them until Bald Eagle takes on a life of his own and becomes a genuinely engaging character. Even the art looks better this issue&#8212;the stark black-and-white style, with many of the backgrounds hidden pure black, provides a strong visual foundation for the narrative to play off of.</p>
<p>As an interesting side note, <a href="http://grotesqueanatomy.blogspot.com/2004/07/pessimistic-previews-street-angel-3.html"><cite class="People">John Jakala</cite>&#8217;s response to <cite>Street Angel</cite></a> is pretty much exactly the opposite of mine, at least w/r/t tone:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;Mastery of tone.  In previous issues, everything &#8220;fit&#8221; no matter how odd or insane it seemed.  In this issue, however, the humor feels out of place given the horrific elements that permeate the tale.</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven&#8217;t read issue #1, so I have no idea how it relates to #2 or #3. &#8220;INCAdinkaDOOM&#8221; appears to be the work of artists with some good ideas but not enough control or discipline&#8212;and &#8220;Going Street Hell&#8221; appears to be the work of confident artists who know exactly what they&#8217;re doing. I have no idea what to expect from issue #4, then, but what I&#8217;ve read so far has convinced me to find out.

<p>I still think the tone in #3 was a bit uneven, but I will agree that all the concepts fit better.  Still, the jarring juxtaposition of concepts in #2 is a big part of what made it so enjoyable for me.  It&#8217;s like Morrison or Monty Python, where all the silliness seems to fit somehow, despite the fact that it obviously doesn&#8217;t, or it wouldn&#8217;t seem so novel.

<div class="text">
<p>Coincidentally, I had a paragraph in this post contrasting <cite>Street Angel</cite> #2 with <cite>Seaguy</cite>. (I took it out because it didn&#8217;t really fit.) I think the difference between <cite>Street Angel</cite> #2 and some of Morrison&#8217;s work is that, in Morrison&#8217;s work, there&#8217;s usually some connecting tissue between the bits of craziness. In <cite>Seaguy</cite>, most of the episodes are superficially unrelated and incongruous, but they subtly build upon each other and set up thematic resonances that sing through the book. &#8220;INCAdinkaDOOM,&#8221; on the other hand, seems to (deliberately?) disrupt any resonances, especially with the Incan/Cortez stuff. That&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing, but I didn&#8217;t enjoy it in this case.
