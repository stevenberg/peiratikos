<div class="text">
<p><cite class="Comics">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</cite> seems particularly fascinated with superheroes and supervillains whose psychological origins lie in formative traumatic events. <cite class="Comics" style="font-style:normal">Batman</cite> of course was born in the injustice of Bruce Wayne losing both his parents to murder. Two-Face was born as acid splashed across Harvey Dent&#8217;s face turned his face into a physical manifestation of &#8220;good vs. evil.&#8221; His &#8220;cure&#8221; apparently only dooms him, his face fixed but his fortune ruined, both sides of his infamous coin marred. Two-Face&#8217;s loss of his human half foreshadows Batman&#8217;s loss of his Bruce Wayne secret identity. It&#8217;s not a good sign when you look into your supervillain enemy&#8217;s face and see a reflection.</p>
<p>The Joker doesn&#8217;t even have an origin, nor a name other than &#8220;Joker.&#8221; Some Web sites I found (<a href="http://www.darkknight.ca/">The Dark Knight</a>, <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/weird2/carnivalofchaos/origin.html">Carnival of Chaos</a>, <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/1/26/19439/5191">&#8220;Madness in Gotham&#8221;</a> on <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/">Kuro5shin</a>) indicate common elements in their versions of his origin story&#8212;a failed career as a comedian, a dead wife and children, a fall into a vat of acid&#8212;but as near as I can tell these are all inventions of the Joker. At any rate, he has no origin and no name in <cite>DKR</cite> as Batman and Two-Face do, he hardly even has a personality beyond his love for Batman and his love of killing.</p>
<p>Bruce Wayne is driven to seek justice by the murder of his parents, Harvey Dent is equally driven to injustice by his horrible scarring. The man who killed Bruce&#8217;s parents had a motivation&#8212;&#8221;He was sick and guilty over what he did. All he wanted was money&#8221; (p. 14). Then Bruce &#8220;was was naive enough to think him the lowest sort of man&#8221; (p. 14), but now, well, now we&#8217;ve got the Mutant Gang, and why do they kill? They have a quota! In a way that&#8217;s worse than anything, because at least Bruce&#8217;s parents&#8217; murderer wanted money, and at least the Joker&#8217;s murders are an act of passion, his own way of showing his love for Batman.</p>
<p>So the Mutant Gang. These poor jerks, their Mutant Leader likes to talk big&#8212;&#8221;Don&#8217;t call us criminals. We are the law. We are the future&#8221; (p. 44)&#8212;but there&#8217;s just something missing. It&#8217;s that thing with assigning murder <em>quotas</em>. Come on, guys, where&#8217;s the love, where&#8217;s the passion for your criminal careers? The Mutant Leader wants to be Batman&#8217;s archenemy, but he just doesn&#8217;t get it. He thinks it&#8217;s all about enacting power struggles through violence, and meanwhile Batman and Two-Face and the Joker are off in <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1076390821#214360"><cite class="People">David Fiore</cite> Transcendentalist superhero land</a>. Batman&#8217;s struggle with the Mutant Leader is played out in testosterone-drenched macho mudwrestling. When he acquiesces to the Mutant Leader&#8217;s &#8220;rules&#8221; for fighting, he&#8217;s nearly killed, but when he retakes control of the conflict he takes down the Mutant Leader effortlessly, almost with <em>superhuman</em> ease, considering he&#8217;s, what, 50 or 60 years old?</p>
<p>Oh, but the Joker and Batman, that&#8217;s a struggle between equals. Do supervillains have to take the Rorschach test? If they do, the Joker certainly failed&#8212;he hasn&#8217;t just lost his human identity, it doesn&#8217;t even exist as memory or history. He&#8217;s become a dark laughing god of death or injustice, haunting Gotham. Almost the opposite of Batman, but not quite, since Batman still has Bruce. In <cite>DKR</cite>, the conflict between Batman and the Joker comes to crisis and must be resolved, but it isn&#8217;t Batman who resolves it. As I said in <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/02/12/bb-bbbat-batman-darling/">my last <cite>DKR</cite> post</a>, Batman can&#8217;t bring himself to kill the Joker, I suppose because Batman thinks he needs the super-injustice of the Joker to juxtapose with his own super-justice to make sense of the world.</p>
<p>I also said that Bruce Wayne/Batman is a weakling, but that&#8217;s really unfair, isn&#8217;t it? His real problem is that he can&#8217;t get away from the weight of his psychological origin. (The Joker certainly has managed that.) To take one of David Fiore&#8217;s favorite superheroes as an analytical foil to Batman: Spider-Man has a psychological origin similar to Batman&#8217;s, involving the murder of a parent figure. Peter Parker, though, gets a lesson out of his Uncle Ben&#8217;s murder&#8212;with great power comes great responsibility!&#8212;which he can internalize and use as a moral guiding principle. The murders of Bruce Wayne&#8217;s parents are entirely negative&#8212;they show young Bruce that the world is an unjust place, and he must invent Batman to fill the moral void he&#8217;s discovered in the world. How much bleaker is Batman&#8217;s story! Bleaker still, Batman isn&#8217;t allowed to internalize. Decades after his origin, in <cite>DKR</cite>, he&#8217;s still driven obsessively by his parents&#8217; murders. It&#8217;s not any current injustices in the world which inspire the return of the Batman, but <cite>The Mark of Zorro</cite>, triggering a flashback to Batman&#8217;s formative trauma. He just can&#8217;t get away from it! Except, listen to his final lines in the book:</p>
<blockquote class="Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, p. 159"><p>It begins here&#8212;an army&#8212;to bring sense to a world plagued by worse than thieves and murderers&#8230; This will be a good life&#8230; Good enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>Happy day for Batman! That sure sounds to me like he&#8217;s finally happy, finally let go of his obsessions, ready to pursue justice for its own sake. And to reach this point, he <em>only</em> had to fail the Rorschach test, conquer Gotham City (with the help of a nuclear explosion and some former Mutant Gang members), fake his own death, blow up Wayne Manor, give Alfred a heart attack&#8230; Well, we are in the realm of grim &#8216;n&#8217; gritty, aren&#8217;t we?</p>
<p>(Totally unrelated to anything else: Turn to page 102, see the third tv panel, the lawyer talking about the Mutant Leader. That red hair, those dark glasses&#8230; Could it be? A cameo appearance by Matthew Murdock!)

<p>Good stuff Steven!</p>
<p>Instructive comparison between Batman &#38; Spider-Man&#8211;I think the key with Peter Parker is that he gets his powers <i>before</i> he suffers through his defining trauma, unlike Bruce, who <i>derives</i> his &#8220;power&#8221; directly from the trauma itself&#8230; I&#8217;ll have more to say once I&#8217;ve actually re-read DKR! I got a little behind on things this weekend&#8230;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s good, Batman gets his power from trauma. So do his villains, I guess. (Are there many supervillains whose origins involve some tragedy? I can think of Dr. Doom&#8230;)</p>
<p>Speaking of &#8220;supervillains,&#8221; though, I think that whole moral binary opposition of &#8220;heroes vs. villains&#8221; takes a harsh beating in DKR, not least through the way the thematic parallels between Batman, Two-Face, and the Joker are played up.
