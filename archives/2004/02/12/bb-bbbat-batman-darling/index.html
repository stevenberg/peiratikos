<div class="text">
<p><cite class="People">LB</cite>, in the comments section of <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/02/11/the-commissioner-is-an-excellent-cop-but-i-think-a-poor-judge-of-character/#comment-64">my previous post on <cite class="Comics">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</cite></a>, notes that <cite class="Comics" style="font-style:normal">Superman</cite> is a necessary figure in any potency-based reading of <cite>DKR</cite>. I think I&#8217;ve covered some of this stuff already, so I&#8217;ll be brief here. Superman is an odd fellow here&#8212;probably the strongest guy on the planet, but one of the weakest characters in the book. He&#8217;s sided with the politicians, and we&#8217;ve seen how effective <em>they</em> are. If <cite class="Comics" style="font-style:normal">Batman</cite> stands up for super-justice, Superman is all about super-politics, super-capitulation to the parents&#8217; groups and Senate subcommittees leading the movement to outlaw superheroes, and that makes Superman so hopelessly impotent that he ends up actually helping set up two of Batman&#8217;s moments of greatest triumph. He can&#8217;t stop the Soviet missile (of course not&#8212;the missile is the ultimate sign of politics&#8217; defeat), and so Batman gets an opportunity to extend his iron fist of justice over Gotham. Then Superman unwittingly plays a role in Bruce Wayne&#8217;s death and Batman&#8217;s apotheosis.</p>
<p>Jesus, you know, this book seems about the most crashingly unsubtle thing I&#8217;ve ever read. I think <cite class="People">Dave Intermittent</cite> in <a href="http://theintermittent.blogspot.com/2004_02_08_theintermittent_archive.html#107647396838508418">a post about <cite class="People">Frank Miller</cite>&#8217;s aesthetic techniques</a> gets at why:</p>
<blockquote class="Dave Intermittent" cite="http://theintermittent.blogspot.com/2004_02_08_theintermittent_archive.html#107647396838508418"><p>&#8230;the genius of Frank Miller is that he at once strips characters to their essence and then inflates that essence until it fills the whole world&#8230; Miller boiled Batman down to his essence; an obsessive, calculated need for violent justice. And then he took this essence and juiced it up into a narrative juggernaut.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm, hmm. Well, Batman is certainly not a subtle character&#8212;well, he&#8217;s hardly a character at all by the end, more a super-symbol of justice. What about Bruce Wayne, though? I&#8217;ve hardly mentioned that name in these posts, and it&#8217;s time for him to make his appearance. I was just talking about this with <cite class="People">Rose</cite> on AIM, and I&#8217;m just going to quote her now because she said it all so well:</p>
<blockquote class="Rose"><p>Who made him a symbol of super-justice? Can he be a symbol and a man? That&#8217;s the Big Martyr question, and I think Batman&#8217;s too frightened to answer it. He&#8217;s only a symbol because he can&#8217;t deal with anything and would rather be a big batimage in the sky than be a man. Even when he upbraids Superman for basically the same thing, he&#8217;s guiltyguiltyguilty. At the end, is he being Batman on his own terms, or is he just being eaten by the symbol?</p></blockquote>
<p>Just think of that&#8230; Bruce Wayne eaten by his own symbol! Now that&#8217;s horrific. Inevitable, really&#8212;after all, Batman&#8217;s origin lies in that day young Bruce fell into a cave and came face to face with some monster bat, &#8220;&#8230;the fiercest survivor&#8212;the purest warrior&#8230; glaring, hating&#8230; claiming me as his own&#8221; (p. 19). Throughout the story, Bruce has visions of that bat, its mouth gaping and filled with flame, ready to devour him. And here&#8217;s something really scary: turn to page 156, see the sixth panel? The Joker&#8217;s corpse, surrounded by fire, burnt to a black sillhouette, mouth gaping and filled with flame.</p>
<p>I think my reading here is returning to a theme that runs through a lot of the textual analysis you&#8217;ll find here on Peiratikos: <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/01/03/prolegomena-to-a-theory-of-why-i-like-stuff/">&#8220;creation of self through narrative&#8221;</a>. How&#8217;s it work? Let&#8217;s return to a quote I pulled from <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1075868818#211084"><cite class="People">David Fiore</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Comics">Watchmen</cite> blogging</a>. David said, what if a superhero&#8217;s superheroic &#8220;adventure consumed his <i>entire life</i>? &#8230; [Peter] Parker&#8217;s activities as Spider-Man enable him to lead a more genuine life&#8211;but those activities themselves are most emphatically <i>not</i> &#8216;life&#8217;&#8230; it&#8217;s <i>not</i> Peter&#8217;s &#8216;true self&#8217; unleashed. And if he got <i>trapped</i> in that condition, he wouldn&#8217;t be a &#8216;free spirit&#8217;, he&#8217;d be more like a wrathful ghost.&#8221; I said in my first <cite>DKR</cite> post that this is what happens to Batman, but of course I should have said that this is what happens to Bruce.</p>
<p>Bruce, a little boy scarred by the murders of both his parents right in front of him, invents Batman to make sense of the world: there is Justice, which is Batman, and the only crime is to be unjust. He creates Batman to make sense of the world, but of course the world doesn&#8217;t cooperate, and so Bruce/Batman finds others like him, hiding behind masks, to help him make sense of the world. Two-Face, the Joker. Mere criminals aren&#8217;t enough for Batman&#8212;a symbol of super-justice needs symbols of super-injustice. The Joker has far more insight into his and Batman&#8217;s relationship than Batman does. His vision of their relationship has poetry:</p>
<blockquote class="Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, p. 140"><p>They could put me in a helicopter and fly me up into the air and line up the bodies head to toe on the ground in delightful geometric patterns like an endless June Taylor dancers routine&#8212;and it would never be enough. No, I don&#8217;t keep count. But you do. And I love you for it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Batman meets his greatest defeat in <cite>DKR</cite> when he can&#8217;t bring himself to kill the Joker. After all, the Joker is Batman&#8217;s reason for existence. This is where Dr. Wolper&#8217;s psychoanalysis of Batman as a &#8220;social disease&#8221; almost gets it right, but misses the point&#8212;Harvey Dent and the Joker may well be weak-willed, but the real weakling here is Bruce Wayne.
