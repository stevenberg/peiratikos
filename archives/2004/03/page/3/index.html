<p>Yes, we&#8217;re experiencing some technical difficulties here (the result of my uploading some <em>test</em> scripts into the main blog directory rather than the test directory on the web server, oops). Until those are resolved, enjoy our fun new look as I switch over to the default WordPress index page for now.

<div class="text">
<p>I don&#8217;t often bother joining the comics-blogosphere (stupid awkward term, it needs an abbreviation&#8212;coblo? comicsphere?) conversations about the economics and politics of the comics industry, but since everybody (<a href="http://realtegan.blogspot.com/#107842348986384100"><cite class="People"> Laura Gjovaag</cite></a>, <a href="http://johnnybacardi.blogspot.com/2004_02_29_johnnybacardi_archive.html#107842325505882157"><cite class="People">Johnny B</cite></a>, <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1078483385#229327"><cite class="People">David Fiore</cite></a>, <a href="http://www.alltooflat.com/about/personal/sean/?BlogNum=693"><cite class="People">Sean Collins</cite></a>, <a href="http://comics.212.net/2004_03_01_archive.shtml#107825760255683135"><cite class="People">Christopher Butcher</cite></a>) is talking about <a href="http://www.sequentialtart.com/indy_0304.shtm">this <cite class="People">Jeff Parker</cite> interview</a> which <a href="http://peiratikos.net/archive/2004/03/03/fun-with-contradictions/">I so cruelly mocked</a>, and since some of those people linked to my cruel mockery, I guess I&#8217;d better go ahead and say my own piece&#8230;</p>
<p>Laura thought I misread Parker&#8217;s point, but honestly, I didn&#8217;t even address the actual content of Parker&#8217;s statements (I was just making a little joke about a tangentially related irony), so I don&#8217;t think my reading of the point is relevant. His basic point, as I recall, once you strip away the somewhat moralistic tone of &#8220;Adults are stealing comics from kids!&#8221; seems to be that comics publishers who want to sell comics to kids should publish comics for kids. Which, well, yes. (As David points out, writing good books for kids can be very hard indeed.) I don&#8217;t think selling more comics to kids is necessarily the only or the best way to &#8220;save the industry,&#8221; but I don&#8217;t really care about the economic survival of DC or Marvel that much anyway. And as for the moralistic tone, well, whatever. Kids are no worse off for having their American superhero comics stolen away from them and made &#8220;adult&#8221;&#8212;they have plenty of manga and other things to entertain them. I&#8217;m sure it would be great if kids had more American comics to read, but Parker&#8217;s allegory of a poor child desperately grabbing for comics as the mean adult comics readers horde them away is really overstating the problem (calling it a &#8220;problem&#8221; is overstating the problem, really).

<p>&#8220;All I ever did was die on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow. I said a while ago that I suspected one of Morrison&#8217;s goals in <cite class="Comics">New X-Men</cite> has been to blow the X-Men out of their rut so they can escape the gravity of bad soap opera and go have fun new stories. I believe my wording was something like &#8220;explode the living fuck out of it all.&#8221; Well, now that I&#8217;ve read <cite class="Comics">New X-Men: Planet X</cite>&#8230; that was an understatement, wasn&#8217;t it!</p>
<p>I really wish Marvel would print page numbers in their TPBs. At the end of issue #148, a little more than halfway through the book, Jean is dead, killed by Logan to end her misery. Logan picks her up, walks out of Asteroid M, carries her into the sun. They burn up, begin to disintegrate&#8212;but Jean wakes, opens her eyes&#8230; No, there is no Jean here, this is Phoenix. In three panels, <cite class="People">Phil Jimenez</cite> and <cite class="People">Grant Morrison</cite> (and to be sure, inker <cite class="People">Andy Lanning</cite> and colorist <cite class="People">Chris Chuckry</cite>, but one of the many disadvantages of corporate comics is the unwieldiness of listing all the contributors)  give us Phoenix risen from the ashes in her glory, the terror of those eyes. Asteroid M breaks apart and is consumed in the white void of the sun&#8212;this is the final panel of the issue, a full page of white with Asteroid M reduced to gray bits of paint in the middle of it.</p>
<p>Phoenix has come to judge, and she does: &#8220;Magneto? You don&#8217;t look <em>anything</em> like him. How can you be Magneto when Magneto is <em>dead</em>?&#8221; Oh, but Magneto&#8217;s reply: &#8220;I will <em>not</em> be judged by children. Give me <em>death</em>. Make me <em>immortal</em>.&#8221; Alas for him, he ruined his bid for immortality by returning from the dead! Charles Xavier&#8217;s judgement is not as succinct as Phoenix&#8217;s, but he gets the point across as he scolds poor Erik that &#8220;[you&#8217;re] just another foolish and self-important <em>old man</em>, with outdated thoughts in his head.&#8221; Of course, even Charles knows now (after the debacle of Open Day in <cite class="Comics">New X-Men: Riot at Xavier&#8217;s</cite>) that there are two foolish and self-important men in the room&#8230;</p>
<p>But now Jean is dead again too. And look at this, in the final two pages of the story (minus the &#8220;150 years later&#8221; coda), this rift begins to open in the page, white bleeding through into the black of the panel gutters. It grows until it fills half the page, and as Jean dies the panels shrink smaller and smaller and finally crumble and disintegrate into the white, alluding to the final image of Asteroid M falling into the sun. Jean died and returned to life in the infinite fires, but now she dies fading into the void.</p>
<p>As Three-in-One say, &#8220;Something&#8217;s gone wrong with the <em>whole universe</em> now.&#8221; Professor X and Magneto, the two poles according to which mutants set their politics, have been discredited and stripped of power, the School is destroyed, New York City is destroyed, hundreds of humans must have been cremated before Magneto was stopped. Logan&#8217;s falling and losing his personhood as he loses control of his life (after seeing whatever he saw in those Weapon Plus files). Scott finally lets his rage go and it&#8217;s so strong and out of control his eye-blasts apparently start burning people. Everybody&#8217;s dying. And it&#8217;s like the world just can&#8217;t take it anymore and splits open at the seams and dies itself.</p>
<p><em>Is this end of the X-Men</em>? Well no, Reload, right? They&#8217;ll be around when Morrison&#8217;s gone. Except&#8230; this sure feels like The End, doesn&#8217;t it? This is apocalypse, the doom of the X-Men, their final judgement.</p>
<p>But then there&#8217;s that epilogue, 150 years in the future, as some people in a flying convertible on the moon discover the Phoenix Egg. Here comes tomorrow indeed, the beginning of a new day as the sun rises and the X-Men are born again. And what now, for these new X-Men?

<h2><a rel="bookmark" href="../../03/referral-spam/index.html" title="Permanent link to Referral Spam">Referral Spam</a></h2>
<p class="postmeta"><a href="../../index.html" title="March 2004 Archive">3 March 2004</a> by <a href="mailto:s&#116;even.m&#46;b&#101;r&#103;&#64;g&#109;a&#105;&#108;&#46;com" title="Send an e-mail to Steven">Steven</a> &#8212; Filed under <a href="../../../../../categories/general/index.html" title="View all posts in General" rel="category tag">General</a>,  <a href="../../../../../categories/internet/blogging/index.html" title="View all posts in Blogging" rel="category tag">Blogging</a></p>
<div class="text">
<p>I was looking through our referrers list here at Peiratikos just now, and I discovered three rather odd referers. I won&#8217;t link to two of them, because they&#8217;re real sites. I will give you the third URL: <code>http://paris-hilton-sextape.blogspot.com/</code>. That&#8217;s not a real URL&#8212;there is no <cite class="People">Paris Hilton</cite> Sex Tape blog. So that&#8217;s clearly not a legit referral, but the other two are highly questionable: one is an Internet service provider and the other appears to be a Belgian company. I.e., not web sites that are likely to link to us.</p>
<p>Folks, the newest innovation in spam has arrived, and it is <em>referral spam</em>. Apparently <a href="http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/archives/john_kerry_referral_spam.php">a lot of bloggers are getting hit with referral spam for <cite class="People">John Kerry</cite>&#8217;s blog</a>, whihc is pretty pathetic&#8212;Paris Hilton spam is to be expected, but when Presidential campaigns start spamming&#8230; or maybe it&#8217;s some Republican script kiddie trying to turn tech-savvy people against Kerry.</p>
<p>At any rate&#8230; come on, <em>referral spam</em>? It&#8217;s wasted on our site, since Rose and I are the only ones who can look at our referrers list. It would certainly cause us a lot of difficulty if we start getting hit hard by this method&#8212;not least because of all the wasted bandwidth used up by serving bogus referrals&#8212;but nobody will actually see the spam ads except us, and it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re going to buy something from a company that 1) spams us and 2) wastes our precious and expensive bandwidth. So whoever decided to spam our referral list made a poor marketing choice. For people who list their referrers on their web sites (I know several bloggers do), this could create a larger public annoyance.</p>
<p>But still, <em>referral spam</em>?

<p><a href="http://www.sequentialtart.com/indy_0304.shtml"><cite class="People">Jeff Parker</cite> wishes adults would stop reading superhero comics, because superhero comics are adolescent power fantasies and adolescents should them, but not adults</a> (thanks to <a href="http://comics.212.net/2004_03_01_archive.shtml#107825760255683135"><cite class="People">Christopher Butcher</cite></a> for the link). And yet, mystery of mysteries, he loves <cite class="Comics">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</cite>. Which is, last I checked, a <em>superhero comic</em>. Right? It&#8217;s about a team of people who are in some way greater than regular people (you might say they&#8217;re&#8230; superhuman!), doing heroic deeds and battling villains who are in some way greater than regular people. I.e., they&#8217;re superheroes fighting supervillains. Right?  Or is it not a superhero comic if the characters don&#8217;t wear spandex costumes and have funny superhero names? But surely our conception of the genre isn&#8217;t that superficial. Or maybe the fact that the characters are borrowed from non-superhero literature makes it not a superhero comic? But the characters are obviously being placed in a new context here, so the fact that Mina Harker wasn&#8217;t a superhero in <cite class="Books">Dracula</cite> doesn&#8217;t change the fact that in <cite>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</cite> she joins what certainly seems to be much like other  superhero teams despite being superficially different. Or wait, I&#8217;ve got it&#8212;superhero comics are adolescent power fantasies, and <cite>The League</cite> isn&#8217;t, so it must be not superheroes. But wait, the notion that superheroes that superheroes are just adolescent power fantasies requires a superficial and ignorant reading of the genre. (Cf. <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1077511005#221691"><cite class="People">David Fiore</cite></a>, <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1077340397#220502">David again</a>, <a href="http://www.alltooflat.com/about/personal/sean/?BlogNum=661"><cite class="People">Sean Collins</cite></a>, <a href="http://www.forager23.com/archives/000220.html"><cite class="People">J.W. Hastings</cite></a>, <a href="http://peiratikos.net/archive/2004/02/24/a-little-more-on-metaphor/"><cite class="People">Rose</cite></a>.) And besides, I must say <cite>The League</cite> is nothing if not adolescent&#8212;it&#8217;s not even trying to be morally sophisticated. Oh, oh, yes, now I&#8217;ve figured it out&#8212;Jeff Parker doesn&#8217;t think adults should read superhero comics, and he reads <cite>The League</cite>, and he&#8217;s an adult, so it must not be superheroes.
