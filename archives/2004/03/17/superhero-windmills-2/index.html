<blockquote cite="http://www.alltooflat.com/about/personal/sean/?BlogNum=727"><p>Another month, another tedious kerfuffle about whether or not superhero stories are inherently bad/childish/stupid. I gotta tell you, for all that superhero-bashers decry the genre&#8217;s tendency to lapse into rote, repetitive predictability&#8211;well, I guess you can see where I&#8217;m going with this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is exactly what I thought after <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/03/16/superhero-windmills/">my &#8220;hilarious takedown&#8221;</a> (so Sean calls it) of <a href="http://www.previewsreview.com/shipthisweek/040317/">Chris Butcher</a>. You&#8217;ll note the permalink URL of my post contained the words &#8220;superhero windmill.&#8221; After I&#8217;d finished that post, I thought, &#8220;Why am I defending superheroes against the windmill that is Chris Butcher? Don&#8217;t I have anything more interesting to say?&#8221; Well, I do, actually. <cite class="People">J.W. Hastings</cite> has written some good stuff about <a href="http://www.forager23.com/archives/000243.html">morality in art</a> and what he calls <a href="http://www.forager23.com/archives/000246.html">&#8220;fuzzy coherence&#8221; in narrative art</a> that I&#8217;ve been meaning to reply to and probably would have been more fun to reply to than yet another attack on Marvel.</p>
<p>As for the minor controversy surrounding <a href="http://www.millarworld.biz/index.php?s=bbfee2291f015f11cbc627e15cb8d9fc&amp;showtopic=22903&amp;st=20&amp;#entry531422">this message-board post on Millarworld</a>, I make note of <a href="http://www.millarworld.biz/index.php?s=bbfee2291f015f11cbc627e15cb8d9fc&amp;showtopic=22903&amp;st=20&amp;#entry532522">this second post from the same fellow</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.millarworld.biz/index.php?s=bbfee2291f015f11cbc627e15cb8d9fc&amp;showtopic=22903&amp;st=20&amp;#entry532522"><p>A few get this absolutely right - Morrison, for example, can raise very complex issues and created sophisticated stories without blowing the intrinsic simplicity of the creations he deals with. That&#8217;s one of the reasons his JLA and X-Men were so faithful to the history of the originals.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d argue that Ultimates is also pretty much spot-on. There&#8217;s nothing there that is really prohibitive for kids but at the same time it has a real edge and sense of danger. Of course, to get to this the characters have to be scrapped and started over - you couldn&#8217;t do it in the 616 universe, though many try with various characters.</p>
<p>Most don&#8217;t get it right and we end up with SpiderMan agonising about his marriage which, frankly, is missing the point of the character by a mile. We get three years of the misery of Banner rather than a fun Hulk story and so on and so on.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can&#8217;t say I agree with his positive assessment of <cite class="Comics">The Ultimates</cite> (especially the part about it being OK for kids), and I&#8217;ve not read enough of <cite class="Comics">The Incredible Hulk</cite> or <cite class="Comics">Spider-Man</cite> to discuss those, but at any rate I agree with his general point. Which, it seems, is merely that superheroes aren&#8217;t fit for psychologically realistic characterization (even if you posit that Batman is insane, dressing up in a rubber batsuit and fighting crime is still pushing the bounds of realism <em>just a bit</em>). There seems to have been widespread confusion that <cite class="People">Richard L</cite> meant this in a pejorative sense, but given that clarification above, as I said, I agree with him. It&#8217;s just embarrassing when Mark Millar comes around claiming his Spider-Man series is going to be&#8212;what was the term he used?&#8212;&#8221;hyperrealistic,&#8221; that we&#8217;ll get to read about how grim &#8216;n&#8217; gritty Spider-Man is and how he has battle scars and stuff (I could find the interview in which Millar says this stuff but I frankly just can&#8217;t be bothered). And, you know, what the hell? <i>I am going to dress up in red and blue spandex and crack wise while beating the living shit out of some guy with metal arms stuck on his back</i> is not a hyperrealistic response to feeling responsible for your uncle getting shot dead. And if it were then Spider-Man wouldn&#8217;t be a superhero, he&#8217;d be a super mental case. I think part of Richard L&#8217;s point is that when you try to do psychological realism with superheroes what you end up with is just sad and pathetic.

<p>Yeah, this is 11 months late, I&#8217;m going to post it anyway.  I think a point to consider, too, in your discussion of &#8220;psychological realism with superheroes&#8221; is not only the detached, &#8220;in-a-bubble&#8221; character development of grown men/cyborgs/aliens in tights essentially ridding the world of OTHER grown men/cyborgs/aliens in tights, but also the reaction of the 99.99% of the population who, for all intents and purposes, are us, the &#8220;real people.&#8221;  Positing whether or not Batman is insane vs. simply unrealistic without discussing why &#8220;pedestrians&#8221; put up with his existance as anything but a raving lunatic is unrealistic in and of itself.  Hell, the average police commissiner would be ripping his hair out having to deal with that situation, as opposed to playing a staid, Barney Miller-style gumshoe.  Character development comes as much from INTERACTION as it does from introspection.  The fact that civilains could even comprehend, let alone harbor positive/negative feelings about the exisitence of these superheros asks us to suspend disbelief.  At this point, then, &#8220;hyperrealism&#8221; is just another buzzword used by people wishing to distinguish their work from &#8220;just&#8221; a comic.

<p>Um, I can&#8217;t even really remember what I was thinking while writing this post 11 months ago, but&#8230; yeah, superhero stories just tend not to be very naturalistic in general, I agree.</p>
<p>Reading this post really confused me for a minute, until I realized Millar wasn&#8217;t using &#8220;hyperrealism&#8221; the way it&#8217;s used in semiotics and postmodern philosophy. But in retrospect, it&#8217;s hilarious that he chose that particular term, given the kind of stuff he tends to write.
