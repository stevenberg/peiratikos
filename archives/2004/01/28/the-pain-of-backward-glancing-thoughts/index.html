<div class="text">
<p>This could be a long, meandery post, so I&#8217;ll get right to the point. Arguments about morality (and plenty of other things) often get phrased in a way that creates some link between the activity in question and historical precedents. I have an example here,  but all I want to know is what mythical past these people are interested in finding again. I&#8217;m not one to think we live in the best of all possible times or anything absolutist like that, but I&#8217;d rather have the freedoms I have now than ones I would have had in plenty of other historical contexts. And so I don&#8217;t know what to do when I read <a href="http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/01/27/editorial_edlet.html">in the <cite class="News">Cincinnati Enquirer</cite>&#8217;s letters to the editor</a>: </p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/01/27/editorial_edlet.html"><p>&#8220;Sexual abstinence and monogamy are major pillars of a lasting society. Children deserve to hear the truth regarding life - anything of true value must be obtained through self-control and seeking to honor the interest of others above self. Without more emphasis on abstinence training in the culture, promiscuity will continue to defraud the masses of true beauty and eventually life itself.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve succeeded so far in staying out of the marriage debates, because my views are strong and not going to convince anyone who disagrees with them.  In fact, I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s right to call them debates when all the terms are contested.  I&#8217;m just interested in the idea that there&#8217;s a way things used to work and that we ought to be working our way back to that. (Well, ok, I also have a lot of interest in the ideal of self-sacrifice, to the extent that this would be one of our categories if I wrote what I think about most often. I think there&#8217;s a lot of good to be found in placing the &#8220;interests of others above self&#8221; and am in many ways not yet comfortable choosing my desires over others&#8217;, but I&#8217;ve also hurt myself almost irreparably in the past by doing this. And so I&#8217;m very conflicted and thinking a lot about it.)</p>
<p>Anyway, going back to going back, in last night&#8217;s episode of <a href="http://www.baroquecycle.com/preview.htm"><cite class="Books">Quicksilver</cite></a>, Isaac Newton was trying to work backwards to figure out what laws god had set to govern the world, and he (Newton) was using geometry rather than calculus because it was less abstract. Because calculus was an abstraction of geometric issues, using it would necessitate distancing himself from the truth. If I still had my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0631205101/qid=1075255260//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i6_xgl14/002-1439852-9455262?v=glance&#038;s=books&#038;n=507846"><cite class="Books">The Search for the Perfect Language</cite></a> I&#8217;d be able to cite all the arguments about in what language god spoke the world into existence. According to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226327728/qid=1075255394/sr=2-3/ref=sr_2_3/002-1439852-9455262"><cite class="People">Herodotus</cite></a>, who didn&#8217;t have the Genesis god to contend with and merely wanted to know what language children raised without language would speak, I think it was Phrygian. So I know there can be a primordial urge to know and understand and contend with who we were, and that&#8217;s what the whole thorny &#8220;creation of self through narrative&#8221; is supposed to address, and I will come back to that theme soon. I&#8217;m just not sure how people hope to do this on a cultural level. And I&#8217;m not even being pedantic about being in a pluralistic society and all that. I just want to know where people want to be, I guess.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t even know what it means to have a society supported by &#8220;sexual abstinence and monogamy&#8221; (presumably as a binary opposition, not simultaneously for any given individual) because I can&#8217;t imagine there&#8217;s ever been one and I&#8217;m not sure what criteria a person could come up with to force any past history into this simple a setup, even after nipping off unnecessary heels and toes. I&#8217;m always interested in the personal metaphors and touchstones that people create for themselves, but it&#8217;s hard to imagine anything that would make me want to project them onto some sort of system of norms. <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/"><cite class="People">David Fiore</cite></a> has lots of fascinating and fun theories about big-R Romantic and Transcendentalist influences in Marvel comics, but that doesn&#8217;t mean (I hope!) that he goes around on message boards telling readers that it&#8217;s the only way to read these comics &#8220;correctly&#8221;.   That was really the core of my initial realization about the &#8220;creation of self&#8221; thing. I understood taht it was a theme that linked most works I really, really enjoy, and that it seemed to be this aspect of them that I found attractive. I don&#8217;t think other people have to see this or like it, but it&#8217;s become a useful system for me.</p>
<p>Growing up, I read a lot of historical fiction, and I haven&#8217;t entirely given it up as an adult. One thing I often find exasperating is putting a modern protagonist with modern sensibilities and tone in the guise of a legitimate historical picture, which can happen in books from <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/01/21/the-moon-lord/"><cite class="Books">The Moon Lord</cite></a> (where it was fascinating in its own way) to the Oprah-approved <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0142001740/qid=1075256718/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-1439852-9455262?v=glance&#038;s=books"><cite class="Books">The Secret Life of Bees</cite></a>, which annoyed me a lot.  Then there&#8217;s the aforementioned <cite class="Books">Quicksilver</cite>, which I&#8217;ll have to blog on more when I&#8217;ve finished it, because the same narrative tricks used in different places in the text seem to be giving me vastly varying impressions. What made history interesting was that it was different from my life, and there are translation issues involved for me to understand (to the best of my ability), and I&#8217;ve always enjoyed thinking about that. I thought about what it would be like to translate myself into a Greek context or a medieval Christian one, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;d advocate moving society in that direction. I&#8217;m not sure I advocate moving society at all. I&#8217;m much more interested in individuals. And it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m interested in them that I wonder why so many of them long for something they never knew, something that exists only in their imaginings, and yet they feel the pain of its absence. I follow my own advice: forget your <em>nostos</em>, but keep your eyes open. For me, at least, it&#8217;s better that way.

<p>Rose,</p>
<p>I love this post!</p>
<p>It speaks in a big way to the kinds of issues I&#8217;ve been debating with Jim Kalb lately&#8230; </p>
<p>And you&#8217;re right&#8211;if I went around telling people they had to think of Marvel super-heroes as &#8220;saints&#8221;, that would make me as big of a jackass as the person who wrote that Cincinnati Enquirer letter&#8230;

<p>I do think there&#8217;s a connection and I&#8217;ll respond later on your blog, if I don&#8217;t die here at work. </p>
<p>I would hesitate to call this guy a jackass just because I don&#8217;t know his situation at all.  It seems more likely he&#8217;s very strong in his convictions, which can be a different thing, though there can be some overlap. I used you as an example because I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d mind, and I&#8217;m glad you don&#8217;t seem to, but even if you did go around telling people how stupid they were not to see the shadow of Hawthorne overwhelming poor little Peter Parker, it wouldn&#8217;t be believing that or even <em>saying</em> it that made you a jackass as much as how you said it.  Hmm, maybe I shouldn&#8217;t be calling my readers hypothetical jackasses.  At any rate, the point is that this is probably just a crank, or someone with a limited/limiting worldview, or perhaps just a plain old optimist, and I wouldn&#8217;t disparage him for that.</p>
<p>As I said, though, more on all this later.
