<p>So far, the major drawback to <a href="http://www.baroquecycle.com/preview.htm"><cite>Quicksilver</cite></a> is that it doesn&#8217;t lend itself to bathtub reading.  The deliberate (I assume!) anachronisms are endearing and the story trips along steadily.  I&#8217;m ashamed I&#8217;m not breezing through it, but I save it for bedtime reading.  Since my Christmas hints went unnoticed, I might as well toss out that an excellent birthday present would be a little shelf that fits over the bathtub and facilitates safe book-balancing.  It makes a perfect gift for someone who hates my writing, since I&#8217;d never bother with the internet if I could live in my bath.  </p>

<p><a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> is the best web-publishing platform I&#8217;ve encountered (certainly tons better than <a href="http://new.blogger.com">Blogger</a>, although Blogger has the advantage of free hosting on blogspot.com). Full compliance with Web standards (so the developers claim, and I believe them), <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/">TrackBack</a>, <a href="http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback-1.0">Pingback</a>, no page rebuilds, pretty typography, smart text formatting, etc., etc. and so forth.</p>
<p>WordPress is open source freeware, but you do need your own web server to host it on. We&#8217;re paying $80 a year to use WordPress rather than Blogger or something, and it&#8217;s more than worth it.

<p class="postmeta"><a href="../../index.html" title="January 2004 Archive">5 January 2004</a> by <a href="mailto:&#115;te&#118;en.m.&#98;e&#114;&#103;&#64;gmail&#46;&#99;om" title="Send an e-mail to Steven">Steven</a> &#8212; Filed under <a href="../../../../../categories/media/comics/index.html" title="View all posts in Comics" rel="category tag">Comics</a>,  <a href="../../../../../categories/media/literature/index.html" title="View all posts in Literature" rel="category tag">Literature</a></p>
<div class="text">
<p><em>Sources used in this post:</em> Borges, Jorge Luis. <cite>Collected Fictions</cite>. New York: Viking, 1998.</p>
<p>How common is the idea that the X-Men are a racism/race-relations metaphor? Because I notice people seem to say it a lot (e.g. <a href="http://www.thefourthrail.com/reviews/critiques/010504/uncannyxmen437.shtml">here</a>), and why do people say it so much? I don&#8217;t see it. OK, I see it, but it seems limiting to suppose the X-Men are merely a racial allegory. There&#8217;s the gay metaphor too. But there&#8217;s more. The most common criticism of the racism and gay metaphors I see is that gay people and Hispanics don&#8217;t have superpowers. Oh, but it&#8217;s a metaphor! It&#8217;s something inside that&#8217;s so powerful, so liberating but also uncontrollable, and once you let it out there&#8217;s no going back. It&#8217;s pride, black pride, gay pride, whatever. The X-Men are a fantasy of political activism. When you&#8217;ve been silenced and made invisible for whatever reason, and then you decide to take pride in whatever makes you an invisible and you stand up and make people notice you and your pride, people will, yes, hate and fear you. That&#8217;s what the X-Men are about. I don&#8217;t see any need to make it about any one kind of pride/activism.</p>
<p>Does this have anything to do with my analysis of <cite class="Comics">New X-Men</cite> in terms of &#8220;creation of self through narrative?&#8221; I think it may. If you&#8217;ve read any stories by <cite class="People">Jorge Luis Borges</cite> or the novel <a href="http://www.vurt-feather.co.uk/"><cite class="Books">Vurt</cite></a> by <cite class="People">Jeff Noon</cite> (I&#8217;m not quite changing the subject here), you&#8217;ll probably know what I&#8217;m talking about when I say both these authors (and many other authors, but I&#8217;m using these two as an example) write fantastic narratives in which the world is a text. I mean, there is no illusion (or the illusion is exploded) that the world of the stories is &#8220;real&#8221;&#8212;the world of, say, &#8220;Tl&ouml;n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius&#8221; is no more real than an encyclopedia, and in fact it ends up being superseded by a fantasy world described in a fictional encyclopedia article. (I have some essays on Borges&#8217;s and Noon&#8217;s work that go into more depth, I should put them on the blog at some point.) Noon especially writes a protagonist who is empowered by the realization that his world is a textual world.</p>
<p>Borges&#8217;s stories aren&#8217;t just clever but inconsequential metafictional games. They propose a way of looking at our own world:</p>
<blockquote cite="Borges, p. 81"><p>
Then years ago, any symmetry, any system with an appearance of order &#8211; dialectical materialism, anti-Semitism, Nazism &#8211; could spellbind and hypnotize mankind. How could the world not fall under the sway of Tl&ouml;n, how could it not yield to the vast and minutely detailed evidence of an ordered planet? It would be futile to reply that reality is also orderly. Perhaps it is, but orderly in accordance with divine laws (read: &#8220;inhuman laws&#8221;) that we can never quite manage to penetrate. Tl&ouml;n may well be a labyrinth, but it is a labyrinth forged by men, a labyrinth destined to be deciphered by men.

<p>(There are some <cite class="Comics">New X-Men</cite> spoilers lurking in here.)</p>
<p>This is the beginnings of what I think will become an actual essay, with footnotes and everything. I am intrigued by <a href="http://grantmorrison.com/"><cite class="People">Grant Morrison</cite>&#8217;s</a> <cite>New X-Men</cite>, but I&#8217;ve not seen a lot of discussion on the Internet about the things that intrigue me (maybe I&#8217;m looking in the wrong places). What intrigues me is analyzing <cite>New X-Men</cite> in terms of Rose&#8217;s theories about narrative art, specifically <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/1/3/prolegomena-to-a-theory-of-why-i-like-stuff/">creation of self through narrative</a>. We&#8217;ve been talking about this a lot lately, and I noted that many (all?) the example narratives we came up with to talk about have as a central conflict the problem of who controls the narrative. I haven&#8217;t seen <cite class="Movies">Capturing the Friedmans</cite> (which Rose talks about in that post I just linked to), but I gather that control (and ownership) of the narratives of people&#8217;s lives is at stake in that story. <cite class="Movies">Paycheck</cite> (which Rose also discusses) is hardly about anything coherent, but it&#8217;s based on a <cite class="People">Philip K. Dick</cite> story (Dick&#8217;s stories are incoherent in a much more interesting way than <cite>Paycheck</cite> the movie), and Dick was always writing about characters losing control of their narratives.</p>
<p>Right, I think <cite>New X-Men</cite> is about characters attempting to create themselves by creating narratives, and it&#8217;s about characters losing control of those narratives. Charles Xavier loses control of his political dream to his evil twin. Henry McCoy tells his ex-girlfriend a little lie and tries somewhat unsuccessfully to turn it to his advantage when it spirals out of control. Emma Frost convinces herself she&#8217;s a good teacher, a good lover, a nurturer, a strong independent person, only to see her life shatter around her. Quentin Quire, after his life is turned topsy-turvy by the revelation that he&#8217;s adopted, constructs a new life for himself out of every possible troubled-teen warning sign and teen-movie cliche (using drugs, bullying, getting in fights, rebelling against authority, turning to radical politics, trying to impress a girl, and much much more) but can&#8217;t control his own inventions. Scott Summers is deeply unhappy with his own (non-)personality but can&#8217;t manage to do anything but stand still as his life goes to hell. Weapon XV bursts through the dome of the World, transcending what was the whole of its existence, only to bindly acquiesce to the controlling forces he finds beyond. (If there are forces beyond comprehension (a military science team running the World, an omniscient god, anthropological determinism, the writer) that know the narrative better than we, can we have any control?) Wolverine gives up control of his own narrative&#8212;decides he&#8217;s the killing machine Weapon Plus says he is and can&#8217;t be more or other than that. So there are all these stories about loss of control and it&#8217;s not just control of power, but control of choice, of selfhood, of the right to be the narrative subject. Loss of control over the narrative of their lives.</p>
<p>There are several things I&#8217;ll be thinking and writing about, in addition to setting out arguments to support my thesis:</p>
<ul>
<li>X-books may be read as very political. What are the politics of <cite>New X-Men</cite>, what do they have to do with creation of self through narrative (or failure to create self through loss of control of the narrative)?</li>
<li><cite>New X-Men</cite> seems optimistic and hopeful (particularly in terms of the X-Men making progress in their political goals), and a lot of people seem to respond strongly and primarily to this in their readings. What&#8217;s the relationship between the surface political optimism and the darker themes of loss of control?</li>
<li>The aesthetics, particularly of the art. What does the sequential-art form do for the text in terms of the narrative themes?</li>
</ul>

<div class="text">
<p>I watched more movies in 2003 than any year before, and that seems to be a continuing trend. I&#8217;ve never been good with movies, neither an ideal nor indulgent viewer, but I have strong views and tastes. I&#8217;m still not sure I can explain or excuse or codify these, but I have a new way of looking at it. When thinking about what I would teach in a film studies course, I thought I&#8217;d focus on the creation of self through narrative, and I realized this would be a way for me to fit in basically all my favorites.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d start the course with one of my 2003 finds, <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=Capturing%20the%20Friedmans%20%28Movie%29&#038;title2=Capturing%20the%20Friedmans%20%28Movie%29&#038;reviewer=Elvis%20Mitchell&#038;pdate=&#038;v_id=278995&#038;reviewer=Elvis%20Mitchell"><cite>Capturing the Friedmans</cite></a> (registration required), which collects personal testimonials from participants in a child sexual abuse scandal of the 1980s. Memory is fickle, and we get to see stories change, move towards or away from verifiable &#8220;truths&#8221; in different tellings, and that doesn&#8217;t even include all the places where truth can&#8217;t get in, real and imagined and reimagined motivations.</p>
<p>A police detective describes stacks of pornography strewn around the house where police photos show there were none. One student speaks of suffering extreme, public sexual abuse, while a classmate denies witnessing or experiencing any of this. Then there&#8217;s the family of the accused, trying to figure out what went wrong and where and how, and how to allocate and accept guilt. It quickly becomes clear that no one has the whole story, no one is a totally sympathetic character. Yet everyone is presumably being honest and forthright and trying to make a public record of The Truth from their perspective. This messy conglomerate gets closer to any sort of truth or understanding than any single narrative could.</p>
<p>I was thrilled with the film for several reasons, but mostly because it makes its postmodern unease so natural and inevitable that no one watching can hope to figure out what really happened, since that whole idea has become nonsensical. Instead, it&#8217;s a story about how the characters decide for themselves what happened, based on what they experienced and also what they want or believe or need to think to keep living as they do, and the audience is complicit in this endeavor. I would like to think even reticent students would be inspired or tempted to continue such evaluation in their own worlds.</p>
<p>So we are the stories we tell, both narrator and protagonist, as well as (un)written product. We are what we see in ourselves and what we refuse to see. I prefer art that acknowledges this, evaluates it, extends it. This trend and focus is antithetical to the Oedipal trajectory, the Hollywood happy ending. Being a creating/created subject means not giving in to that closure, not accepting closure at all.   After watching a movie this summer (and I won&#8217;t give away its name for fear of too much spoiling, and because it basically doesn&#8217;t matter)  I&#8217;d said that every human story ends in death. What I meant by this in that particular case was that it should never be a surprise <em>that</em> death comes to a character, only <em>when</em> it does. Beyond that, there can be a rightness to a story&#8217;s conclusion, but no certainty, no predestination.</p>
<p>As a counterbalance, we watched <cite>Paycheck</cite> last night, perhaps a mistake. Ben Affleck is Michael Jennings, a reverse engineer of the future (in this case, December 2003) who, awakening with his memory wiped, realizes he&#8217;s sent himself clues to destroy the world-rending machine he&#8217;s created, not to mention stopping the Evil Corporate Executive who set him up, as well as Getting the Girl. It was painful to see all the clues available, see how long it took the characters to make banal and obvious observation and then wait for the inevitable conclusion. I laughed a lot, and did not stifle it as well as perhaps I should have. This was a movie with no narratives at all, really, just a mess of cliches, and certainly with no selves to the characters.  Because of this (and other things, including truly inept dialogue) I found no way in, nothing to care about, no way to invest myself in the characters or the story or anything at all except the movie&#8217;s (be/a)musing pseudoclockwork.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve gotten at what I like or what I mean, but I&#8217;ll come back to it later. I like my plots tight, my writing literary or sharp, but most of all my protagonists self-aware. I sometimes take &#8220;self&#8221; loosely and am not even sure this covers everything I like, but it seems like a good start and a safe barometer so far. At least I have some nascent theoretical explanation for my snobbishness now, and a new year in which to develop and test it.
