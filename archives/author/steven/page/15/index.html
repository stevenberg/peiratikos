<p class="postmeta"><a href="../../../../2004/05/index.html" title="May 2004 Archive">13 May 2004</a> by <a href="mailto:stev&#101;n.m.&#98;erg&#64;gmail&#46;&#99;o&#109;" title="Send an e-mail to Steven">Steven</a> &#8212; Filed under <a href="../../../../../categories/media/comics/index.html" title="View all posts in Comics" rel="category tag">Comics</a></p>
<div class="text">
<p>At first, <cite class="Comics">Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again</cite> reminded me of <cite class="Movies">Gigli</cite>. No, seriously. <cite>Gigli</cite> is a movie in which some parts are good, other parts are good but you find yourself asking &#8220;Why the hell&#8217;s that in <em>this</em> movie?&#8221; and other parts make you hope they&#8217;re an absurdist parody but you have this horrible feeling the director actually wants us to watch that final scene with the mentally retarded kid whose only dream in life is to meet the hot babes of <cite class="Television">Baywatch</cite> and find it <em>touching</em> and <em>heartwarming</em>&#8230;</p>
<p>So <cite>DK2</cite> was like that, except mostly scenes in the latter two categories.</p>
<p>Now I think that&#8217;s probably much the effect <cite class="People">Frank Miller</cite> and <cite class="People">Lynn Varley</cite> were going for. (Miller and Varley are both listed on the front cover, and <cite class="People">Todd Klein</cite> is listed just below them on the title page, no information about what each actually did on the book, which I think is neat because the message seems to be &#8220;We are all equally authors of this text&#8221; but I suppose it would be annoying if you didn&#8217;t already know who each author was and which parts of the text he or she contributed. At any rate, hereafter I&#8217;m going to go auteur and refer to the &#8220;author&#8221; as &#8220;Miller&#8221; and &#8220;he.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Something just occured to me: the plot, such as it is, of <cite>DK2</cite> involves Lex Luthor and Brainiac faking an alien invasion to maintain their control of the populace (and to kill off the pesky superheroes). Sound familiar&#8230;? Yeah, <cite class="Comics">Watchmen</cite>! An allusion? I think so. And <cite>DK2</cite> pretends to be a sequel to <cite>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</cite>, but it really doesn&#8217;t work as a sequel&#8212;it&#8217;s more of an extended allusion ot <cite>DKR</cite>.</p>
<p>How would you feel if you fancied yourself something of an iconoclast in the realm of superhero comics, somebody who&#8217;s not so worried about preserving traditions, who in fact likes to kick tradition in the ass and go looking for fun new stuff&#8230; and you found that people have <em>canonized</em> a comic you created 15 years ago? You&#8217;d feel a lot like Frank Miller must have when he decided to write <cite>DK2</cite>, I bet. Miller doesn&#8217;t strike me as the sort who likes his books to be safe. But <cite>DKR</cite> is second only to <cite>Watchmen</cite> in safeness&#8212;not that either of these books is safe or comfortable if you read them and pay attention, but they&#8217;re safe in that they have such a status among comics readers that they&#8217;re practically untouchable and most negative criticism is met with indifference at best, even though many readers would probably be hard pressed to explain just why they&#8217;re so great without resorting to mumbling about &#8220;deconstruction&#8221; and other fancy words they probably can&#8217;t define. They&#8217;re respectable comics.</p>
<p>Canons and classics are just fine, no doubt about it, but if you revere the canon at the cost of ignoring other good new comics, comics will stagnate. How many times have you heard somebody say &#8220;There has never been a comic since <cite>Watchmen</cite> that was as good as <cite>Watchmen</cite>&#8221; or &#8220;<cite>Watchmen</cite> is the best comic ever written&#8221;? I&#8217;ve seen lots of people say things like that, and it&#8217;s bullshit. There have been piles and piles of superhero comics as good as or better than <cite>Watchmen</cite> and <cite>DKR</cite>. Miller doesn&#8217;t want to be safe and respectable, he wants to kick tradition in the ass and blow up icons. <cite>DK2</cite> is his powerful projectile aimed directly at the reputation of <cite>DKR</cite>. The projectile is&#8230; Superman and Wonder Woman, united in carnal embrace.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t read <cite>DK2</cite>, trust me, you have to read the Wonder Woman-Superman sex scene yourself to grasp its full impact. Superman has just been beaten up by Batman, blown up by the Flash, shot full of Kryptonite by Green Arrow, and had the Atom inserted directly into his brain: he&#8217;s in bad shape. Wonder Woman finds him at the site of the erstwhile Fortress of Solitude and berates him, saying among other things, &#8220;Where is the hero who threw me to the ground and took me as his rightful prize?&#8221; Yes, Wonder Woman, doing a Red Sonja act! Then she and Superman fuck each other&#8217;s brains out so hard that, I&#8217;m not kidding folks, they cause catastrophic seismic and weather disruptions across the entire world. If your reaction as you read this passage (pp. 111-124 of the trade paperback collection) isn&#8217;t something like &#8220;What the <em>fuck</em>???&#8221; then you are entirely too jaded for your own good. And that&#8217;s exactly the reaction Miller&#8217;s going for. Whether you think it&#8217;s good reading hardly matters (I do not think it is good reading, I think it scarred my poor innocent brain for all eternity). What matters is that Miller has broken free of the limited bounds within which Superman and Wonder Woman had been allowed to operate. <cite>DK2</cite> has many other more, dare I say it, subtle ways of breaking free, like giving Superman and Wonder Woman a daughter (who, in one of the book&#8217;s best scenes, demands that Superman tell her about Kryptonian sex).</p>
<p>If I haven&#8217;t made it clear, I had a lot of fun with <cite>DK2</cite>, although to a certain extent it&#8217;s not a book that was designed to be liked (at least, not liked by everybody). The fact that so many people hate it is arguably a sign of success&#8212;I suspect Miller deliberately wrote a book he knew a lot of people would hate, not just to screw with his fans but as proof against it&#8217;s ever losing its edge and becoming safe and comfortable.

<div class="text">
<p>Hey, I&#8217;m back! For now&#8230; I&#8217;ve been having lots of trouble connecting to the Internet lately (entirely the fault of the awful campus network I&#8217;m on, so there&#8217;s not much I can do about it except graduate and move someplace with a good network), and given that I am preparing to graduate in about two weeks, I&#8217;ll probably be a bit busy in the near future and so the no-blogging trend may continue. I have lots of stuff to write about, but no time and an uncooperative Internet connection.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://imdb.com/title/tt0378194/quotes"><p>Superman stands alone. Superman did not become Superman, Superman was born Superman. When Superman wakes up in the morning, he is Superman. His alter ego is Clark Kent. His outfit with the big red S is the blanket he was wrapped in as a baby when the Kents found him. Those are his clothes. What Kent wears, the glasses the business suit, that&#8217;s the costume. That&#8217;s the costume Superman wears to blend in with us. Clark Kent is how Superman views us. And what are the characteristics of Clark Kent? He&#8217;s weak, unsure of himself&#8230; he&#8217;s a coward. Clark Kent is Superman&#8217;s critique on the whole human race, sort of like Beatrix Kiddo and Mrs. Tommy Plumpton.</p></blockquote>
<p>This, of course, is Bill&#8217;s monologue on <cite class="Comics">Superman</cite> from <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill Vol. 2</cite> (which <cite class="People">Quentin Tarantino</cite> apparently &#8220;borrowed&#8221; from <cite class="People">Jules Feiffer</cite>&#8217;s book <cite class="Books">The Great Comic Book Heroes</cite>). This is the most obvious possible interpretation of Superman, and frankly I&#8217;m surprised at the number of people I&#8217;ve encountered who seem deeply impressed by this allegedly brilliant interpretation. What did you folks <em>think</em> Superman was about?</p>
<p>Actually, I disagree with Bill. Well, certainly he&#8217;s right that Clark Kent isn&#8217;t the real guy, he&#8217;s a character Superman made up so he doesn&#8217;t have to be Superman all the time. However! Superman isn&#8217;t the real guy either&#8230; <i>Superman</i> certainly isn&#8217;t his real name, his name is Kal-El. (Or Kal-L on the erstwhile Earth-2.) That&#8217;s his Kryptonian name&#8212;so is the Kryptonian Kal-El the real guy? But he was never really Kryptonian. Sure, in the pre-Crisis DC Universe (and Bill has us talking pre-Crisis here, the weakling coward Clark Kent is a pre-Crisis artifact), it seems like half the population of Krypton managed to escape, what with Supergirl, Krypto, the bottled city of Kandor, and whatever other obscure Kryptonians were lurking around&#8212;but even with all those Kryptonians around, Kal-El could at best get history lessons. He couldn&#8217;t ever be part of a living Kryptonian culture. And anyway he certainly didn&#8217;t grow up Kryptonian. He grew up American, but his extraterrestrial origin and his superpowers serve as constant reminders that he&#8217;s far from a natural citizen. Even his powers aren&#8217;t naturally Kryptonian. He&#8217;s an emigrant from a place which doesn&#8217;t exist and which he never knew, to a place from which his alien genetics always separate him.</p>
<p>Superman has plenty of alter egos, but no natural self. His only nature is alienation from nature. He is, in fact, <a href="http://notthebeastmaster.typepad.com/weblog/2004/04/metaphor_shmeta.html">a metonym</a> of human nature, which is alienation from nature. What Christians call Original Sin, alienation from God. What people are looking for when they give up the hectic bustle of modern life and join a commune or something. The immigrant embodies this alienation physically, and Superman takes immigration to the next level: not only is he from another <em>planet</em>, he&#8217;s from another planet that <em>blew up</em> and no longer exists. It&#8217;s like Genesis without the moral judgement and without Happy Heaven as a final reward after a life of struggling to get back to Eden. Superman&#8217;s only reward for the true selves he tries to cobble together out of the pieces he&#8217;s been left with is no more and no less than whatever self he manges to cobble together. His life as Superman, Clark Kent, Kal-El are the closest he&#8217;ll ever get to Heaven. (This is one reason I find attempts to make Superman a Christ figure amusing. Or bemusing. He descends from some idealized place and takes on the burden of humanity, right, but then he doesn&#8217;t have any Heaven to ascend to! He&#8217;s like the first half of a Christ figure, which just means he&#8217;s human.)</p>
<p>As long as I&#8217;m writing about Superman&#8217;s identities I should note that <a href="http://www.whiterose.org/howlingcurmudgeons/archives/005816.html"><cite class="People">Chris Maka</cite></a> and <a href="http://ringwood.blogspot.com/2004_05_02_ringwood_archive.html#108396014637912415"><cite class="People">Ken Lowery</cite></a> are also pondering superhero identities. Ken specifically offers some criticism of the Punisher&#8217;s own identity issues, which makes sense but don&#8217;t trust me, I&#8217;ve never read any <cite class="Comics">Punisher</cite> comics.

<div class="text">
<p>Did I say I was going to <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/04/21/invisible-crisis/">write more about <cite class="Comics">The Invisibles</cite></a>? I may have lied about that&#8230; I&#8217;d like to reread the whole series before I get into it.</p>
<p><a href="http://ynot.motime.com"><cite class="People">David Fiore</cite>&#8217;s</a> latest topic is <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1082980729#265154"><cite class="People">Joseph Campbell</cite>&#8217;s nefarious influence on some branches of superhero criticism</a>, and further explanation of <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1083064573#265819">corporate superhero universes as postructuralist narratives</a>. Here&#8217;s my crazy theory for the day: <cite class="Comics">Crisis on Infinite Earths</cite> is <cite class="People">Marv Wolfman</cite> and <cite class="People">George P&eacute;rez</cite>&#8217;s attempt to mythologize the DC Universe. See David:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://ynot.motime.com/1083064573#265819"><p>Obviously, myths <i>are</i> the products of many minds&#8212;but myths <i>qua</i> myths certainly aren&#8217;t <i>perceived</i> that way. Mythology is a &#8220;homogenous&#8221; body of work, the structuralist&#8217;s dream come true&#8212;it is taken for granted that, given enough time, a rigorous exegete could tease THE meaning out of the canonical writings. </p></blockquote>
<p>And again:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://ynot.motime.com/1082980729#265154"><p>Joseph Campbell is the ultimate modernist&#8212;at <i>war</i> with the &#8220;superstructure&#8221;/&#8220;false consciousness&#8221;. There&#8217;s only <i>one</i> hero see? And there aren&#8217;t many archetypes, either. Just focus kids, that modernist light will see you through the haze of multiplicity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just replace &#8220;hero&#8221; with &#8220;universe,&#8221; and there you go. I don&#8217;t have a lot to add now <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/04/21/invisible-crisis/">beyond what I&#8217;ve already written</a>, except to note the connections. Of course, <cite>Crisis</cite> didn&#8217;t succeed in its goal of homogenizing the DC Universe even remotely, and it seems to have created the conditions in which <cite class="People">Mark Waid</cite> and <a href="http://grant-morrison.com/"><cite class="People">Grant Morrison</cite></a> were able to incorporate poststructuralism into the very textual fabric of the DC Universe with the introductoin of Hypertime. Just look at this, <a href="http://warrenellis.com/"><cite class="People">Warren Ellis</cite>&#8217;s</a> attempt to describe Morrison&#8217;s description of Hypertime, taken from the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/hypertime2000/index2.html">Unofficial Hypertime Website 5.0</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.geocities.com/hypertime2000/features/morrison.html"><p>Take a glass sphere studded all over with holes, and then drive a long stick right through the middle of it, passing exactly through the center of the volume. That&#8217;s the base DC timeline. Jab another stick through right next to it, but at a different angle, so that they&#8217;re touching at one point. That&#8217;s an Elseworlds story. Another stick, this one rippled, placed close in so that it touches the first stick at two or three points. That&#8217;s the base Marvel timeline. Perhaps others follow the line of the DC stick for a while before diverging, a slow diagonal collision along it before peeling off. This sphere contains the timeline of all comic-book realities, and they theoretically all have access to each other. In high time, at the top of the sphere, is OUR reality, and we can look down on the totality of Hypertime, the entire volume.</p>
<p>Hypertime is a tool for the consideration of fictional reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>The funny thing about <cite>Crisis</cite> is that it posits &#8220;trying to discover the orign of the universe&#8221; as the action which leads to the splintering of the universe into a frightening multiplicity&#8212;and then not only must the characters in the story go back to the origin of the universe themselves in order to prevent the disaster which was caused by somebody observing the origin of the universe, but Wolfman and P&eacute;rez and all the other creators who built the post-Crisis universe necessarily look to the origin of the DC Universe in &#8220;recreating&#8221; it and bringing it &#8220;back to basics.&#8221; According to the mythology of <cite>Crisis</cite>, it&#8217;s practically a cosmological law that <cite class="People">John Byrne</cite> would come along and fuck everything up with his <cite class="Comics">Man of Steel</cite>!</p>
<p>Can anybody who knows more about this stuff than I do tell me if DC still uses Hypertime? Readers, at any rate, seem unaware of it, or at least don&#8217;t seem to consider it as an implicit textual explanation for, say, why the <cite class="People">Jeph Loeb</cite>/<cite class="People">Jim Lee</cite> <cite class="Comics">Batman</cite> is so different from the <cite class="People">Brian Azzarello</cite>/<cite class="People">Eduardo Risso</cite> <cite>Batman</cite>. I know Mark Waid uses Hypertime in <cite class="Comics">The Kingdom</cite>. Are there any Morrison comics that use it? Does it come up in <cite class="Comics">JLA</cite> ever?

<p>Every time somebody <a href="http://www.alltooflat.com/about/personal/sean/?BlogNum=773">says something like this</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.alltooflat.com/about/personal/sean/?BlogNum=773"><p>It&#8217;s really for the best if you ignore the people who didn&#8217;t like Kill Bill Volumes One and Two, which taken together comprise one of the best movies I&#8217;ve ever seen. </p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s really for the best if you ignore them! <cite class="People">Sean Collins</cite> said that. Why, I can&#8217;t imagine. Maybe he&#8217;s joking, but he mostly just sounds indignant. I guess he thinks only people who agree with him are worth paying attention to. How boring.</p>
<p>He also says:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.alltooflat.com/about/personal/sean/?BlogNum=773"><p>I do, however, wish I knew how people can watch a movie in which bad behavior occurs and, because they find the film amusing on some level, deduce that that bad behavior is being endorsed&#8211;particularly in an oeuvre like Tarantino&#8217;s, in which characters who refuse to renounce violence and deceit are inevitably punished for that refusal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I personally didn&#8217;t find the &#8220;bad behavior&#8221; (I guess that would include raping a comatose woman, as well as the comotase woman eating off her rapist&#8217;s face, both pretty bad behavior) amusing, and I didn&#8217;t think the bad behavior was endorsed, so that&#8217;s fine. Actually, scratch that, a lot of the <em>Bride&#8217;s</em> bad behavior was most certainly endorsed, or at least <em>looked upon with some approval</em> by Tarantino&#8212;<a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/04/20/kill-bill-foundations-audience/">and members of the audience</a>. Actually, the way Sean puts it here, which isn&#8217;t really a way I&#8217;d thought about it before, makes the movie seem way more fucked up than I thought at first&#8212;it gives us violent setpieces which are filmed in such a way as to entertain and exhilarate us, and then it says &#8220;Oh, but this violent which is so exciting and fun to watch is bad! These characters must be punished!&#8221;</p>
<p>I wish I knew why <cite class="People">Quentin Tarantino</cite> and people in the audience Rose and I watched it with find this movie so amusing.</p>
<p>Oh, and pointing out other movies that immorally play gratuitous violence for laughs doesn&#8217;t exactly absolve <cite>Kill Bill</cite>&#8230; or maybe Tarantino does it <em>morally</em>?</p>
<p>And really, I came out of the theater thinking <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill Vol. 2</cite> was much better than <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill Vol. 1</cite>, which I sort of liked but had lots of problems with, and I thought &#8220;Hey, get rid of that stupid Buck chapter and <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill</cite> works pretty well,&#8221; but it&#8217;s such a frustrating movie, and I can&#8217;t figure out if it&#8217;s good frustrating or bad frustrating. I fear it&#8217;s both, and I fear Tarantino didn&#8217;t think it was supposed to be frustrating at all.</p>
<p>I do hope we get to hear why <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill</cite> is one of the best movies Sean has ever seen. And Sean, I am curious, given your outspoken views on feminism and misogyny in movies like <cite class="Movies">Dogville</cite>, to hear your thoughts on the issue of sexual and sexually violent exploitation of women characters for entertainment.

<div class="text">
<p>Unfortunately, I think <cite class="People">Nate Bruinooge</cite> over at <a href="http://polytropos.org/">Polytropos</a> <a href="http://www.polytropos.org/archives/000375.html">has it right about <cite class="People">Quentin Tarantino</cite> and <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill</cite></a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.polytropos.org/archives/000375.html"><p>Another, darker failing of his that has finally become clear to me is this: he finds abhorrent violence terribly funny. One of his strengths has always been the fact that he does not sugercoat violence, or pussyfoot around its most graphic and troubling aspects. He doesn&#8217;t allow us to get comfortable. But I&#8217;m afraid this may be accidental, because for him the violence we&#8217;re talking about &#8212; a goon splurting blood from a lost limb, a woman thrashing on the floor after losing her last eye &#8212; is already comfortable for him. If this is true it is rather damning of the man, not necessarily his work, though this particular movie seems to be a clear expression of his personal quirks unfettered by editorial critique or high inspiration.</p></blockquote>
<p>I really only have one thing to say about <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill Vol. 1</cite>, I guess (I&#8217;d probably have more to say if I watched again): OK, Buck? Who likes to fuck? How the hell did this shit not end up on the cutting room floor? It&#8217;s stupid, it&#8217;s nonsensical, it&#8217;s one of the most repugnant comedic-abhorrent-violence scenes in either volume of <cite>Kill Bill</cite>. <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill Vol. 2</cite> makes even clearer how wrongheaded the chapter is&#8212;it&#8217;s totally self-contained, it has nothing to do with the rest of the story (except for mild jokes about the Pussy Wagon), it serves only to dilute the sexualized violent relationship between the Bride and Bill. It turns the Bride from a person who was specifically victimized in specific ways by Bill into a general sexually victimized woman. With the Bride and Bill, you don&#8217;t <em>have</em> to read it as some kind of commentary on gendered violence or victimization of women or something, but the Buck chapter pretty well requires a reading pertaining to those themes, since there&#8217;s zero characterization of Buck or the trucker rapist or the Bride anywhere to be found and so there&#8217;s nothing to think about <em>but</em> the general gender politics. So are we supposed to <em>cheer</em> or something when the Bride eats off her rapist&#8217;s face? Jesus. And then we have to say&#8230; Well, gee, is the <em>whole movie</em> about violence against women or something? Is it supposed to be some kind of statement about victimization of women in action movies? Or is the Buck chapter just stupid and nonsensical and totally unrelated to everything else?</p>
<p>Is the movie a repugnant statement or is it just badly designed?</p>
<p>Well, anyway, here&#8217;s what I think about Vol. 2:</p>
<p>The best scenes in the movie manage to be at once trite and powerful. Most of them involve little B.B. Take the scene in which Bill explains to B.B. how he shot Mommy. The dialogue goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Bill:</b> I shot Mommy right in the head.<br />
<b>B.B.:</b> Why, did you want to know what would happen?<br />
<b>Bill:</b> No, I knew what would happen to Mommy when I shot her in the head. But what I didn&#8217;t know&#8230; was what would it would do to <em>me</em>.<br />
<b>B.B.:</b> What did it do to you, Daddy?<br />
<b>Bill:</b> Well, it made Daddy very sad.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s totally ridiculous and trite, but, well, it&#8217;s <em>true</em>, in a way. Tarantino uses B.B. to let his characters say things he could never get away with otherwise. They&#8217;re talking to a child, so they can talk like children. I said the stuff like this is trite, but also powerful, because it cuts right to the core of a lot of action movie morality, which is often painfully na&iuml;ve. Take <cite class="People">John Woo</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Movies">The Killer</cite>. Where did I just see something insightful about John Woo? Ah, right, from <a href="http://theintermittent.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_theintermittent_archive.html#108250206312969061"><cite class="People">Dave Intermittent<cite></cite></cite></a>, in an attempt to formulate a taxonomy of martial arts action movies:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://theintermittent.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_theintermittent_archive.html#108250206312969061"><p>The second type [of martial arts movie] is played straight. Which is not to say realistic; but it takes its own absurdities very seriously. It doesn&#8217;t wink at the audience. And because it takes itself seriously, it can reach for something beyond simply entertaining an audience. Its lunacy becomes contagious; it can aspire to narrative power. Think about (not a kung fu movie, but the point remains) John Woo&#8217;s Hard Boiled. It makes, frankly, no sense at all, either in its narrative or its physics. It&#8217;s honor/betrayal paradigm shouldn&#8217;t really work, given what its yoked to; and explained to people who haven&#8217;t seen the film, it often doesn&#8217;t. But as a movie&#8230;it works. Oh man, how it works. It works because Woo never doubts that it should work, or lets on that he knows it shouldn&#8217;t. Woo never admits that his films are cartoons, and his belief that they aren&#8217;t transmutes them from cartoons into something more.</p></blockquote>
<p><cite>The Killer</cite> is another great example of this kind of movie. Woo obviously wants <cite>The Killer</cite> to be a tragic movie about violent people whose lives and the lives of the people they love end in horrific violence, but the thing is, the violence looks so damn fun! It&#8217;s exactly like a bunch of children playing cops &#038; robbers or cowboys &#038; injuns or the simplest, purest version of childhood violent play, the immortal Guns. Do children still play Guns nowadays? Just run around shooting each other, great fun. <cite>Kill Bill</cite> seems to want to acknowledge the childlike (childish?) quality of play in action movies, most obviously in the toy guns scene. Beatrix has tracked Bill to his home, she stalks through it looking for him, she steps onto the back porch&#8230; where Bill and B.B. stand holding toy guns. After some dramatic narration by Bill, B.B. fires her weapon: &#8220;Bang bang, you&#8217;re dead, Mommy.&#8221; Then Beatrix just stands there, looking at her daugher for the first time in both their lives, and this one closeup of <cite class="People">Uma Thurman</cite> lasts maybe five seconds, and damn if that&#8217;s not about the hardest five seconds of film to watch that I&#8217;ve watched in a while. And ooh, Tarantino <em>gets it</em>, he&#8217;s taken the unconscious childlike-play metaphor of so many action movie gunplay scenes and literalized it. OK, sure, he falls victim to the same childlike ecstasy of violence in this very movie, but really, what an interesting way of dealing with it&#8212;put an actual child in the movie and let&#8217;s see if we can turn those trite statements about violence into something profound(ish). Maybe. Then I just now thought, &#8220;Yeah, but this is the same movie (OK, same two movies) with Buck Who Likes to Fuck, remember?&#8221; and that sort of ruins the effect, I have to admit.</p>
<p>I liked the goldfish scene, too, its parallelism with the Elle Driver scene. Elle is the goldfish outside its tank, flopping around after Beatrix pulls her eyeball out. Then Beatrix stomps on the eyeball&#8212;just like B.B. stomped on her poor goldfish. Yeah, trite and obvious, but that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re going for here.</p>
<p>Speaking of Beatrix&#8230; Beatrix? Beatrix Kiddo? I didn&#8217;t get the &#8220;Trix are for kids&#8221; joke until Rose pointed it out to me, and now I wish she hadn&#8217;t, because damn. Why is &#8220;Beatrix Kiddo&#8221; bleeped out in the first movie? What&#8217;s the allusion (there must be one)? Does it have anything to do with anything other than being an allusion? Some of the pastiche works as part of the text&#8212;Rose <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/04/21/kill-bill-bang-bang/">talks a bit about how the Western stuff works</a>&#8212;but too many of the references seem to exist only as references, so that the text becomes sort of a laundry list of movies Tarantino has seen. The name-bleeping may not be the best example, because there&#8217;s a lot of reasonably good stuff about names and identities (the Superman speech! another pretty good scene) and the name-bleeping probably ties in to that. Still. Other seemingly pointless allusions apply. Am I supposed to be impressed that Tarantino has seen every single movie ever made? How boring. Why don&#8217;t I just watch the actual <cite class="Movies">Once Upon a Time in China</cite> and <cite class="Movies">The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</cite> instead?</p>
<p><cite>Kill Bill</cite> frustrates me, you may have noticed. The more I want it to be a good movie, the more I wonder if it doesn&#8217;t want to be a good movie.</p>
<p>It does have some amusing dialogue, though.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Budd:</b> She&#8217;s got a Hanzo sword?<br />
<b>Bill:</b> He made one for her.<br />
<b>Budd:</b> Didn&#8217;t he swear a blood oath to never make another sword?<br />
<b>Bill:</b> It would appear, he has broken it.<br />
<b>Budd:</b> Well&#8230; maybe you just tend to bring that out in people.</p>
<p><b>The Bride:</b> You good with that shotgun?<br />
<b>Janeen:</b> Not that it matters at this range, but I&#8217;m a fuckn&#8217; surgeon with this shotgun!</p></blockquote>

<p class="postmeta"><a href="../../../../2004/04/index.html" title="April 2004 Archive">21 April 2004</a> by <a href="mailto:&#115;te&#118;&#101;n.m.berg&#64;&#103;mail.com" title="Send an e-mail to Steven">Steven</a> &#8212; Filed under <a href="../../../../../categories/media/comics/index.html" title="View all posts in Comics" rel="category tag">Comics</a></p>
<div class="text">
<p>First, <cite class="People">David Fiore</cite> has a piece on <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1082560466#261966">superhero universe continuity</a>, offering an alternative to the &#8220;(non)adherence to past events&#8221; axis used by fanboys and anti-fanboy-fanboys of all kinds. More useful to sophisticated readers is &#8220;awareness of tradition,&#8221; of which &#8220;(non)adherence to continuity&#8221; is only a part. And we can retire &#8220;retcon&#8221; in favor of &#8220;reinterpretation,&#8221; which is all it is. Once we get rid of the comics jargon, we can see that the interesting thing about continuity isn&#8217;t history, it&#8217;s historiography&#8212;it&#8217;s not how the account of Captain America&#8217;s life in <cite class="People">Mark Gruenwald</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Comics">Captain America</cite> contradicts <cite class="People">Jack Kirby</cite>&#8217;s <cite>Captain America</cite> that&#8217;s interesting as much as how Gruenwald&#8217;s interpretation of Cap relates to <cite class="People">Jack Kirby</cite>&#8217;s and those of other creators who&#8217;ve worked with Cap. Good stuff.</p>
<p>Now, <cite class="Comics">The Invisibles</cite> and <cite class="Comics">Crisis on Infinite Earths</cite>. The worlds in <cite>Crisis</cite> are destroyed by a &#8220;wall of anti-matter,&#8221; a white wall the color of a blank sheet of paper progressing implacably across the universes. Just behind the wall of white comes a cloud of inky black, the Antimatter Universe itself filling in the void left by the destruction of each universe. Pages 119-120 (of the <acronym title="trade paperback">TPB</acronym> edition published 2000)  is the best demonstration of this. On page 119, in seven panels that stretch entire height of the page, an image of some planets in the universe containing Earth-1 or Earth-2 (it&#8217;s not clear) goes from full color to increasingly washed-out blue, and the panels become increasingly narrow, until the seventh &#8220;panel&#8221; is an absence, without even a panel border, a unmarked field of white paper from the right side of the sixth panel all the way to the edge of the page. Page 120 has nine panels in a regular grid&#8212;the first panel again defines a negative space of blank white paper with no panel border, the second and third panels show wisps of gray gas or smoke moving in from the corners of the negative space, and the second and third rows of panels show the space filling with smoke until the final panel is the opposite of the first, a rectangle of black. Well, well, what could all this mean? Let&#8217;s let the Harbinger explain the Crisis.</p>
<blockquote><p>Please, listen to me, for our current crisis began <i>ten billion years ago</i>&#8230; The Earth was little more than cooling <i>gases</i>, showing none of the possibilities <i>time</i> would someday offer.</p>
<p>No, the Crisis began <i>elsewhere</i>&#8230; on the world called <i>Oa</i>&#8212; a world of immorals&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;of limitless <i>hope</i>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;and of endless possibilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Harbinger speaks, her speech bubbles are superimposed on images of the planet Oa and its enlightend inhabitants.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Oans lived in paradise. Their minds and bodies were things of perfection. In such a world one would expect a <i>winding down</i>&#8230; a lessening of continued advancement&#8230; but such was <i>not</i> the case. They strove always for improvement of the mind and spirit&#8230;</p>
<p>Their science has never been equaled&#8230; but there were some who used their powers for their own twisted desires.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now just wait till you see what those &#8220;twisted desires&#8221; were&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>[Concerned Oan:] &#8220;Krona, you <i>know</i> the legends&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>[Krona:] &#8220;Bah! Such stories are tales only <i>fools</i> would fear. I seek to learn the <i>origin of the universe</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>[Krona:] &#8220;And you talk of the legends of <i>destruction</i> should I learn the truth. You are a <i>dolt</i>!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Krona&#8217;s not much like the other Oans. Sure, he&#8217;s blue like the rest of them, but he&#8217;s larger, stockier, he looks like he could kick most of their asses, and like he wants to. He&#8217;s always sneering, and he&#8217;s always drawn in closeup from below, so we&#8217;re looking right up his nose and he looks like a pig.</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite all pleas, Krona continued his ceasless labors&#8230;</p>
<p>[Krona:] &#8220;An image forming? A <i>shadow</i>&#8230; like a giant hand&#8230; with something&#8230; a cluster of <i>stars</i> inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then it happened. A terrible cosmic bolt splintered his machine and would have destroyed Krona, too, had he not been immortal&#8230;</p>
<p>It was not the end of the universe as the Oan legends foretold&#8230; but the beginning of something new&#8230;</p>
<p>Something terrible!</p>
<p>Something&#8230; evil&#8230;</p>
<p>The universe <i>shuddered</i>&#8230; and the evil <i>antimatter universe</i> was formed. But more than that&#8212;the <i>single universe was replicated</i>. What was <i>one</i> became many. At that moment was born both the <i>antimatter universe and the multiverse</i>.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>There&#8217;s</em> a &#8220;twisted desire&#8221; for you&#8212;wanting to know the origin of the universe makes you evil! This is an epistemological critique of the state of the pre-Crisis DC universe, as <cite class="People">Geoff Klock</cite> argues in his book <cite class="Books">How to Read Superhero Comics and Why</cite>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;by looking into origins, existence is splintered into a variety of mutually exclusive interpretations that have no center. The current state of the DC universe&#8212;all of the continuity problems and confusions and paradoxes&#8212;Umberto Eco&#8217;s oneiric climate&#8212;is the retroactive result of looking too closely for a guiding principle (p. 20).</p></blockquote>
<p>Creators playing in the DC universe constantly reinterpret and build upon the past, and those reinterpretations were actually incorporated into the fictional world through the multiverse concept. <cite class="Comics">Flash</cite> with Barry Allen isn&#8217;t just a reinterpretation of the Jay Garrick <cite>Flash</cite> comics, it actually takes place in the next universe over and Barry can vibrate through the boundary and have a chat with Jay. It&#8217;s like the theory of temporal physics in which every probabilistic event causes one timeline to split into several timelines, one for each probabilistic outcome. The problem is, how do you know which is the original timeline? How do you distinguish Truth from the countless interpretations of the Truth? <cite class="People">Marv Wolfman</cite> and <cite class="People">George P&eacute;rez</cite> think they have an resolution to this crisis: <em>don&#8217;t look</em>. If you think you know the truth and you look to verify it, you&#8217;ll just end up finding all these interpretations of the truth, and how do you know <em>your</em> truth isn&#8217;t just another interpretation, and if it is then how do you figure out which one of the needles in this stack of needles is the <em>real</em> truth? Nasty question. So let&#8217;s say&#8230; <em>this</em> needle is the real one, and all these other needles&#8212;let&#8217;s just have the Anti-Monitor get rid of those ones, shall we? Tragic to lose all those needles, but at least now we only have one, and that&#8217;s much more convenient.</p>
<p><ins datetime="2004-04-21T21:46Z">[Insertion, added 9:46 UTC] And obviously, the advancing antimatter wall is encroaching nihihlism. According to Wolfman and P&eacute;rez, the inevitable result of a multiplicity of interpretations of the truth is that we are all consumed by nihilism&#8212;unless some band of heroes manages to stop the nihilists (usually &#8220;postmodernists,&#8221; outside of superhero comics) from infecting the rest of the world with their poisonous &#8220;There is no truth!&#8221; philosophy. The metaphor arguably breaks down when the heroes&#8217; method for defeating nhilism is to punch it <em>a lot</em>&#8230; or does it break down? Maybe physical combat is a good metaphor for the epistemological battle to save Truth.</ins></p>
<p>But what does <cite class="People">Grant Morrison</cite> have to say about all this in <cite class="Comics">The Invisibles</cite>? That&#8217;s the question for next time!

<p>Can you <em>believe</em> that? &#8220;From the award-winning writer and artist of Daredevil&#8221;??? &#8220;From the writer of some of your favorite Marvel comics&#8221;??? Now all the stupid Marvel Zombies will buy these books <em>for no good reason</em> and the comics industry will drive me to hang myself after slitting my wrists!</p>
<p>Yeah, and does <cite class="People">Chris Claremont</cite> have a clause in his special X-Men contract that specifies every third cover of a comic book he writes must feature a mysterious villain standing over the fallen bodies of the X-Men? You&#8217;d think at some point some villain would think, &#8220;Damn, here I am standing over the fallen bodies of the X-Men, why don&#8217;t I just <em>kill the bastards</em> and be done with it?&#8221; But apparently this never occurs to them, which is why they&#8217;re villains&#8212;because we all know Good Guys always win, so you must be stupid to be a Bad Guy.</p>

<p>You know this <cite class="Comics">Powerless</cite> comic, the one that&#8217;s a What If? story but I guess we&#8217;re not calling them that anymore?</p>
<blockquote cite="http://comics.toonzone.net/solicitations/2004-07/marvel.php"><p>By re-imagining Marvel&#8217;s most popular characters without superhuman powers, this series will strip these heroes to their core, exploring what it means to be a hero in very human terms.</p></blockquote>
<p>What if Matt Murdock, Peter Parker, and Logan didn&#8217;t have powers, would they still be heroes or would they just be like a regular lawyer, a regular student/photographer, and a regular amnesiac Canadian or whatever the fuck Logan is? You know, considering Logan was born about 150 years ago or so, if he weren&#8217;t a mutant then wouldn&#8217;t he be <em>dead</em>? I bet Wolverine&#8217;s subplot in <cite>Powerless</cite> is that you just get page after page of his tombstone.</p>
<p>No, actually, judging by the cover image below, Logan&#8217;s answer to the question &#8220;What does it mean to be a hero?&#8221; is &#8220;Claws!&#8221;</p>

<blockquote cite="http://whenwillthehurtingstop.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_whenwillthehurtingstop_archive.html#108244739928354197"><p>Comic books are the playground of the retarded. Whether your particular retardation is social, physical, sexual or mental, if you care enough to read this you are a retard.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why, you ask? Well, you see&#8230;</p>
<blockquote cite="http://whenwillthehurtingstop.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_whenwillthehurtingstop_archive.html#108244739928354197"><p>The comics field is stronger than its been in years, with kids and women reading Manga, &#8220;art&#8221; and &#8220;alternative&#8221; comics racking up critical acclaim and respectable sales totally independent of the direct market, online comics coming into their own after a turbulent adolescence, and even the dead newspaper strip showing faint signs of life. But there are still not enough comics readers to support books like &#8220;Wildcats 3.0&Prime; and &#8220;Stormwatch: Team Achilles.&#8221; This tells me that not only is the average mainstream comic reader functionally illiterate, as well as sincerely retarded, but that we have a deeply unhealthy industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK? Got it? You might think Tim&#8217;s insults are pretty offensive, but really I think we all know, even if we don&#8217;t like to admit it&#8230; we really <em>are</em> a bunch of semi-literate retards, aren&#8217;t we? It&#8217;s why we read comics&#8212;we can&#8217;t read them, but we can look at the pictures.</p>
<p>Now, maybe you didn&#8217;t get <cite class="Comics">Stormwatch: Team Achilles</cite> because you were too busy reading other comics you like. Maybe you didn&#8217;t get <cite class="Comics">Wildcats Version 3.0</cite> because you have limited funds and can&#8217;t afford to buy every superhero comic that&#8217;s &#8220;critically acclaimed&#8221; and you decided to read <cite class="Comics">New X-Men</cite> or <cite class="Comics">X-Statix</cite> instead. Maybe you just don&#8217;t like superhero comics, or you don&#8217;t like military science fiction, or you don&#8217;t like stories about corporate politics. Maybe you were too busy reading your &#8220;art&#8221; comics? Too busy with <cite class="Comics">Persepolis</cite> to support <cite>Stormwatch</cite>? Whatever. We&#8217;re talking good, critically acclaimed comics here, and they needed your support! Oh, you didn&#8217;t think they sounded interesting to you? I guess you&#8217;re a retarded illiterate conservative fanboy, huh? I guess you suck?</p>
<p>You know what else I hate? The fact that <cite class="Comics">Powers</cite> and <cite class="Comics">Kabuki</cite> are guaranteed to quintuple, if not sextuple, their sales when they move from Image to Marvel. Maybe even <em>septuple</em>. There&#8217;s nothing I hate more than Marvel Zombies buying good comics. I&#8217;d rather see these comics get cancelled for low sales than see people buy them for the <em>wrong reasons</em>!</p>
<p>Stupid fanboys. Everything is your fault.</p>
<p>(Seriously, though, Tim goes so far over the top that he&#8217;s probably as tongue-in-cheek as I am here. You never can tell on the Internet, can you?)</p>
<p>(You may wonder how I managed to type all this, being the illiterate retard that I am. Actually, I&#8217;m dictating to a friendly monkey dressed as Beppo the Super-Monkey. Thanks, Beppo!)</p>

<div class="text">
<p>I just lost a really long post about <cite class="People">Grant Morrison</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Comics">The Invisibles</cite>, which probably won&#8217;t teach me to save my work as I write even though it should. Well, here&#8217;s a somewhat shortened version.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the difference between Jack and Boy in a nutshell, from <cite class="Comics">Kissing Mister Quimper</cite>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Boy: &#8220;&#8230;There&#8217;s gotta be more to life than running <i>all</i> the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack: &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s gotta be it, ey? I don&#8217;t know: I just run &#8216;cause it&#8217;s quicker than <i>walking</i>, me.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I had an utterly brilliant comparison between Boy&#8217;s leaving the Invisibles and Cipher&#8217;s trying to get back into the Matrix in <cite class="Comics">The Matrix</cite>! Alas, alas. It&#8217;s a pretty obvious difference, though: Cipher is an asshole who betrays his crewmates, Boy is the first Invisible to really get an important part of what&#8217;s going on. Let&#8217;s look at some narration from the last issue of <cite>Invisibles</cite>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m there at the end of the world that was and the beginning of birth into full understanding&#8212;fusion with the supercontext. I am part of &#8220;nature.&#8221; Every airplane, every power station is a result of &#8220;Nature&#8217;s&#8221; process. We never fell. We were never apart from the world. We lied to ourselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>That applies to humanity as a whole&#8212;we thought we were fallen and reaching up toward God or enlightenment (religious people thought so, anyway), but we&#8217;re only a fetus trying to be born. It also applies to the Invisibles specifically, who think they&#8217;re separate from the normal world. Jack calls the non-Invisible world the &#8220;fucking land of the dead,&#8221; but he&#8217;s wrong. Running may be quicker than walking, but walking gets you moving forward all the same.</p>
<blockquote><p>But now we&#8217;re being born, fully-grown, like insects, like Athena, the Goddess of Truth. Larval consciousness experiences the introduction of necessary inoculating agents from the supercontext as a form of invasion by hostile, bacterial forces. The inoculation is conceptualized by the developing larva as an invasion of threatening &#8220;not-self&#8221; material&#8230; the confronting and integration of &#8220;not-self&#8221; being a necessary stage in the development of the maturing larva&#8217;s self-awareness&#8212;&#8221;philogeny recapitulates history.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is what Boy figured out: you don&#8217;t need to be Invisible to help bring the world to birth. As long as the Invisibles stand apart from the world, they&#8217;re as much &#8220;not-self&#8221; as the Lost Ones and other followers of the Outer Church. You want to integrate with the &#8220;not-self&#8221;? Go talk to your neighbor. Go have sex and have a baby&#8212;genetic metaphor of the synthesis of self and not-self. It&#8217;s not that the Invisibles are bad, not that all the Invisibles should be like Boy. It&#8217;s just that their purpose is not to save the world from the Outer Church or from itself, but to engage in the process of integration. Mr. Six and some others do it by blurring the distinction between Invisible and Outer Church until the whole thing is a hopeless mess of quadruple agents and nobody knows who&#8217;s on what side. Jack does it by eating the Outer Church&#8217;s King of the new Aeon. King Mob does it by inventing a video game/drug that turns people into Invisibles. Lord Fanny does it with genderbending. Ragged Robin does it by writing herself into the story. Boy, maybe the most radical Invisible of all, does it by going home and living a little life.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what superheroes like Neo and Friends in <cite>The Matrix</cite> never quite figure out: you can&#8217;t save the world by treating the people in it like helpless cattle. If they really rely on you to rescue them from the Forces of Darkness and Control, the only thing you accomplish by rescuing them is to set <em>yourself</em> as the new Forces of Darkness  and Control. Neo&#8217;s going to free all the humans from the Matrix? And what gives him the right to make that decision for the entire species? This is part of what Boy means when she says, &#8220;I stopped needing to save the world. Saving is what misers do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tomorrow: Philogeny recapitulates history? Spurious biology, memes, and <cite>The Invisibles</cite> as critical response to <cite class="Comics">Crisis on Infinite Earths</cite>!
