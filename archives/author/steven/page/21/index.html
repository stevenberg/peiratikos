<p>Well, you&#8217;ve probably noticed the total lack of style on the site right now. We&#8217;re in the middle of a fairly major overhaul of the site which is taking longer than expected&#8230; CSS should be functional sometime today. Also watch out for some fun new features.

<div class="text">
<p><a href="http://bigsunnyd.blogspot.com/2004_01_01_bigsunnyd_archive.html#107385899584921106"><cite class="People">Big Sunny D</cite> responds</a> to our <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/1/3/new-x-men-narratives/">X-Men blogging</a>. What he says about recent developments in Cyclops&#8217;s soap-opera love triangle sound very good to me, and I think the connected Scott-Emma-Jean and Scott-Jean-Logan love-triangle plotting has been a central focus for the <cite class="Comics">New X-Men</cite> themes I&#8217;m interested in. Right now I&#8217;m thinking: the Cassandra Nova storyarc plays with the themes in a crazy overwrought fantasy metaphor, <cite class="Comics">New X-Men: Riot at Xavier&#8217;s</cite> does them as a revisionist critique of the X-Men political metaphor, the Weapon Plus stuff does them as a story about turning control of your self over to a higher power. And the love triangles revolving around Scott&#8217;s pathetic motionlessness is of course doing them as good old-fashioned X-Men soap opera. Moreover, I read the soap-opera plotting as metacriticism, about the X-Men property itself losing control of its narrative in decades of directionless subplotting muck.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be getting rather tedious, Scott dear. These reruns of your grief.&#8221; That&#8217;s a great line, hinting at that metacriticism. Is Scott&#8217;s absurd love life a microcosm of the X-Men, endlessly repeating old stories, the Dark Phoenix Saga, Days of Future Past, Days of Apocalypse, ad absurdum? Morrison&#8217;s <cite>New X-Men</cite> has been hailed (and derided) as the first truly new thing to happen to the X-Men in a long time, but look what we get: Phoenix. Soap opera. A now-he&#8217;s-dead-now-he&#8217;s-not plot twist with Magneto. An apocalyptic-future storyline. Ooh hoo, the newness. Is what&#8217;s new a sense of playfulness about the way the stories are told? I hasten to note that <cite>New X-Men</cite> is practically the first X-Men comic I&#8217;ve ever read, but I get the impression (from, e.g. <a href="http://www.forager23.com/archives/000160.html"><cite class="People">J.W. Hastings</cite>&#8217;s post on the X-Men</a>) that the X-Men have been rather a serious and grim bunch for quite a while. The <cite class="People">Stan Lee</cite>/<cite class="People">Jack Kirby</cite> <cite class="Comics">X-Men</cite> issues I&#8217;ve read are not surprisingly very fun and playful, so the fun and playfulness of <cite>New X-Men</cite> isn&#8217;t so new, but it certainly seems to be a change. Even when bogged down in the awful art and nonsensical mysticism of the Cassandra Nova story, <cite class="People">Grant Morrison</cite> manages to keep his words both light and serious, joking around (&#8221;You&#8217;re my favorite super hero, Scott,&#8221; one of my favorite lines) and suggesting some pretty heavy thematic stuff below the surface, which kept me going without too much effort even as I gnashed my teeth at hideously drawn characters babbling about evil psychic twins built out of Charles&#8217;s spare body cells.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not as confident with thinking and talking about the art as I am the writing, but I have some vague ideas about it. I think one thing Frank Quitely manages to do is capture Morrison&#8217;s sense of energy and fun. And there&#8217;s something about his tiny stick-figurish Emma and Jean that&#8217;s both creepy and endearing, I don&#8217;t know what.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m getting really interested in the Cassandra Nova stuff in preparation for Cassandra returning in <cite>Here Comes Tomorrow</cite>. My goal for this weekend is to reread the first couple TPBs and blog my thoughts on them. I also need to think more on the evolution of the X-Men concept over the decades, which is going to require an expedition in search of early-Claremont-era stuff, probably some <cite>Essential X-Men</cite> and maybe the <cite>Dark Phoenix Saga</cite> and <cite>Days of Future Past</cite> if I see them.

<p>Well, I haven&#8217;t read this particular issue of <cite>New X-Men</cite> yet, but I can think of a few alternate readings of the passage other than as criticism of moral complacency in the face of &#8220;theocratic fascism&#8221; and &#8220;nihilist terrorism.&#8221; E.g., as criticism of the moral complacency of liberal-interventionist defenders of &#8220;civilization&#8221; who&#8217;ve decided they&#8217;ve got this &#8220;civilization&#8221; thing down better than so-called &#8220;theocratic fascists&#8221; and &#8220;nihilist terrorists.&#8221; Or even better, you could read it as a criticism of moral complacency just in general.</p>
<p>(N.B. You needn&#8217;t read this as a critique of Sean&#8217;s politics, which I don&#8217;t know a lot about since I&#8217;ve not read many of his blogging on politics. As far as I know Sean is a perfectly non-complacent liberal-interventionist defender of civilization, self-aware and capable of self-criticism.)
