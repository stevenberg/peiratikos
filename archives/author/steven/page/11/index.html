<p><cite class="People">Tim O&#8217;Neil</cite> has returned to tell us (<a href="http://whenwillthehurtingstop.blogspot.com/2004_02_01_whenwillthehurtingstop_archive.html#107744336080150608">again</a>) <a href="http://whenwillthehurtingstop.blogspot.com/2004_06_01_whenwillthehurtingstop_archive.html#108745692212931628">why superheroes can&#8217;t be taken seriously</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://whenwillthehurtingstop.blogspot.com/2004_06_01_whenwillthehurtingstop_archive.html#108745692212931628"><p>In a lot of ways, this hearkens back to the &#8220;literature of ethics&#8221; conversation of a few months back. As we discussed then, the &#8220;literature of ethics&#8221; concept was good except for one teeny-tiny fact: there is no examination of ethical dilemma in 99.9% of all superhero books. Black and white, good and evil, are pretty much accepted as is, and any shades of grey are presented as mere obstacles to be overcome. So, when you pick up The Avengers or Superman, the unspoken assumption is that the powerful superbeings whose adventures take place therein are morally infallible creatures whose strange abilities give them the obligation to combat &#8220;evil&#8221; outside of the traditional constraints of our legal system&#8230; Which is why I just don&#8217;t think an intelligent, grown adult can seriously accept most superhero books on face value&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ignoring the unsupported blanket statement<sup><a href="index.html#note-218-1">1</a></sup>, the problem with Tim&#8217;s argument is that phrase, &#8220;at face value.&#8221; As <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1087467131#293752"><cite class="People">David Fiore</cite> pointed out</a>, &#8220;what intelligent adult accepts <i>anything</i> they read at face value?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the really weird thing about Tim&#8217;s argument is that it implies that it&#8217;s good for children to read pro-fascist literature and take it seriously. What?</p>
<hr />
<p><sup id="note-218-1">1</sup> The only reasonable answer to the claim that an arbitrarily large percentage of items in a certain category suck is to cite <a href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/s/SturgeonsLaw.html">Sturgeon&#8217;s Law</a>. &#8220;99.9% of X sucks&#8221; and &#8220;99.9% of everything sucks&#8221; are both cop-out statements, because they seek to avoid addressing specific problems by throwing generalizations at them and hoping they go away. They deserve each other. The bulk of Tim&#8217;s argument is based on such a cop-out generalization, so it&#8217;s hard to take too seriously. His real point seems to be that <em>he prefers</em> to read superhero comics in a childlike (uncritica)l manner rather than an adult (critical) manner, and his elaborate justifications merely obfuscate this.

<div class="text">
<p><a href="http://www.ait-planetlar.com/ccx.shtml"><cite class="Comics">Couscous Express</cite></a> was published in 2001 by <a href="http://www.ait-planetlar.com/">AiT/Planetlar</a>. Its authors are <cite class="People">Brian Wood</cite> and <cite class="People">Brett Weldele</cite>. Becuase it <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/06/09/page-numbers/">has no page numbers</a>, I will begin counting with page one as the first page of the story proper, which begins with the words &#8220;Olive Yassin: age sixteen.&#8221;</p>
<p><cite>Couscous Express</cite> has an odd passage on pages 46-49. Olive, sixteen-year-old daughter of Turkish immigrants, has just purchased a sniper rifle. (She has contacts with gunrunners&#8212;her boyfriend Moustafa is a &#8220;mercenary courier&#8221; who does everything from smuggle guns to escort &#8220;political personnel to and from embassies&#8221; [p. 8]. Where she got the money to buy a sniper rifle is unclear, unless her gunrunner friends are just loaning it out. Later, she gets some grenades.) Moustafa&#8217;s partner Special is going to teach her how to shoot, but Olive doesn&#8217;t need the help: she&#8217;s a perfect shot. Her explanation for her skills? &#8220;I got <em>cable tv</em>. I know how to <em>shoot</em>. Jesus&#8221; (p. 49). Remember a few years ago when there was a minor scare about computer games because some of the perpetrators in school shootings played <cite class="Games">Doom</cite>? Well, Olive&#8217;s a step up from that&#8212;she doesn&#8217;t need to play games to practice shooting, she learned to be an expert sniper just by <em>watching</em> movies! There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any <em>other</em> explanation for her shooting skills (Moustafa doesn&#8217;t let her use guns, she got the sniper rifle behind his back), so I guess we can take her at her word. Olive succeeds in her fights against the Turkish Scooter Mafia because she&#8217;s immersed in American pop culture.</p>
<p>So&#8230; what? Olive is better because she knows how the story goes? This comes up a little at the end, too, when Olive half-mockingly&#8212;and not too convincingly&#8212;admits she&#8217;s finally learned the importance of Family and stuff. <cite>Couscous Express</cite> doesn&#8217;t deal with this theme much beyond the sniping-practice scene, but it&#8217;s what jumped out at me when I read it. It seems connected to assimilation into American culture, leaving behind old traditions and casting about for something to hold onto in their absence. These are the big themes in <cite>Couscous Express</cite>. Olive has the rebellious American teenager thing down so perfect, she&#8217;s stuck in a place where she can&#8217;t have a relationship with anybody without screaming &#8220;Fuck you!&#8221; at them. The only steadying force in her life is Moustafa, who gives her her one basically non-dysfunctional relationship. She&#8217;s racing into a nasty dead end (rebellious teenager schtick), pursued relentlessly by the old (Turkish Scooter Mafia), but in the end she&#8217;s rescued by the criminal fraternity of mercenary rollerblade couriers and a violent American-style action story&#8230;</p>
<p>Weird little story, but fun.

<p><a href="http://www.ait-planetlar.com/blogs/2004_06_06_index.shtml"><cite class="People">Larry Young</cite></a> has this to say about people&#8217;s interpretations of <cite class="Comics">Demo</cite> (look for the 11 June entry):</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.ait-planetlar.com/blogs/2004_06_06_index.shtml"><p>I very much enjoy readers&#8217; interpretations of Brian Wood and Becky Cloonan????????s Demo. It????????s interesting to me, personally, that most audience members find the various snapshots of Demo so compelling that it seems, to me at least, that many readers are missing the lemon because of the meringue. Many folks who should ostensibly know better get fixated on the what-happens-then or the but-what-about-the or the he-didn????????t-take-responsibility or whatever. Me, I think they????????re not getting the fact that the story is <i>the story</i>. You????????re on the bus, or you????????re not. No need to blame the bus.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure. On the other hand, though, maybe <em>some</em> readers got the lemon and just didn&#8217;t think it was very good lemon. The story is the story is the story, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the story doesn&#8217;t have flaws. I thought <cite>Demo</cite> #6 (the only issue I&#8217;ve read) is a pretty good little story, but I was following <a href="http://johnnybacardi.blogspot.com/2004_06_01_johnnybacardi_archive.html#108621105361528344">one discussion</a> that included people who found it unsatisfying, and everybody involved in the dicussion had cogent arguments for their readings of the story. Some readers found the severe disconnect between the frame story and the flashback troubling and annoying. I found it troubling, but I also found that that troubling disconnect was at the center of my reading of the story. (Actually, I found it quite annoying as well, at first, but I changed my mind.) <cite class="People">Brian Wood</cite>, who participated in the discussion, apparently didn&#8217;t <em>intend</em> there to be a troubling disconnect at all. I can see how all three of these interpretations work&#8212;I find <a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/2004/06/07/what-you-wish-for/">my own</a> most compelling, certainly, but I can see how the others work. My point: there are lots of ways to read any text, and the ways you don&#8217;t care about aren&#8217;t irrelevant (even if <em>you</em> are the author or the publisher&#8230;).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jkason/85753.html"><cite class="People">Jason Kimble</cite></a> also replies to Larry Young, and makes a good point:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jkason/85753.html"><p>Truly impressive writing works on all the applicable levels, or at the very least plays a skilled magician&#8217;s game of compelling the reader to focus on the levels that work while failing to notice those that aren&#8217;t quite so solidly constructed.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t managed that, you haven&#8217;t managed it. Playing &#8220;you just don&#8217;t get it&#8221; does no one any good, and just leads to a lot of naked emperors prancing around. While that might make for good porn, it&#8217;s not the best way to encourage critical thought and improve your storytelling skills.</p></blockquote>
<p>Authors can&#8217;t choose <em>for</em> readers which parts of the text readers should focus on. If a reader chooses to focus on a part of the text the author considers irrelevant, it&#8217;s not that the reader is &#8220;fixating&#8221; and is &#8220;just not getting&#8221; it&#8212;it&#8217;s just that, well, that part isn&#8217;t so irrelevant after all.

<p>If any comics publishers read this, hear my cry in the wilderness: we need page numbers! This is a serious problem in comics publishing. In my experience, DC is the only publisher that consistently produces books with numbered pages. Marvel books <em>never</em> have page numbers, not even the <acronym title="trade paperback">TPB</acronym>s. I just flipped through all the Image and Dark Horse I found lying around&#8212;no page numbers. I pulled out a couple other books published outside the major American publishers&#8212;the only one I can find with page numbers is <cite class="Comics">Persepolis</cite>. Thank you <cite class="People">Marjane Satrapi</cite>! I&#8217;ve just flipped through about ten comic books and only one of them has numbered pages!</p>
<p>My problem here is, I&#8217;ve decided to be better about citations in my critical writing. Among other things, this means I&#8217;d like to cite page numbers of books. This, of course, is very difficult when the books have no page numbers. It&#8217;s not too bad with Marvel books, since they&#8217;re usually collected reprints of single issues and I can just count from the beginning of each issue rather than the beginning of the entire book. But I just read <cite class="Comics">Couscous Express</cite> (published by the blogosphere&#8217;s favorite &#8216;indie&#8217; publisher <a href="http://www.ait-planetlar.com/">Ait/Planetlar</a>), and I&#8217;d like to write about it, and I&#8217;d like to cite page numbers when I reference specific passages&#8212;but it has no page numbers! And there are no chapter divisions, so I&#8217;ll have to count myself from the very beginning of the book. I&#8217;ll probably get a pen and write in my own page numbers, but I shouldn&#8217;t have to do that. Comics creators and publishers, please number the pages of your books!
