<p><b><cite class="Comics">Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s Precious Little Life</cite> vol. 1, written and drawn by <cite class="People">Bryan Lee O&#8217;Malley</cite>, is a lovely book. It does not, however, have <a href="http://peiratikos.net/archives/2004/06/09/page-numbers/">page numbers</a>. Boo! You should read it anyway, though. You should read this <a href="http://www.onipress.com/retailers/SCOTTPILGRIM-PREVIEW.pdf" type="application/pdf">PDF preview</a>.</b></p>

<h3>I&#8217;m not a fighter I&#8217;m a lover<br />
but if you run<br />
better run for cover</h3>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.radiomaru.com/comics/short/scott_pilgrim_promo_comic.jpg">Scott</a>, are you a lover or a fighter?&#8221; asks Young Neil. &#8220;He&#8217;s totally both, but he won&#8217;t admit it,&#8221; says Stephen Stills. Scott answers both, &#8220;Hey! I&#8217;m not just both! I&#8217;m <b>so much more</b>!&#8221;</p>
<h3>Lover. Fighter. Rock Star. Hero. And So Much More. This is Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s Precious Little Life.</h3>
<p><cite class="People">Alan David Doane</cite> writes in his <a href="http://comicbookgalaxy.com/081004review.html">review of <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite></a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://comicbookgalaxy.com/081004review.html"><p><b>Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s Precious Little Life</b> is, among other things, a story about the dumb things guys do in their 20s, and the complicated minefield that is the relationship tapestry of any group of people, but especially, again, those in their hormone-soaked early adult years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s irresponsibility comes from a romanticism that seems inspired more by video games and rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll than by Byron. Scott celebrates love and heroism, and he embraces his own individuality to the point of annoying his friends. He has no connection to reality. He obsesses over his romantic fantasies, but he can&#8217;t figure out that the URL for <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/">Amazon.ca</a> is <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/">amazon.ca</a>. When his brilliant plan to lure the delivery girl of his dreams to his door is thwarted by <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/">Amazon.ca</a>&#8217;s inability to deliver CDs within minutes of his ordering them online, he flies into a rage. Reality for Scott is a half-glimpsed mystery that continuously thwarts his attempts to escape it, but he seems to have managed for 23 years to avoid facing it, with little consequence. He&#8217;s a freeloader with no job prospects, but he&#8217;s collected a group of friends willing to support him as he pursues his own romantic individuality.</p>
<p>His strategy in life is to elevate banal experience into narratives of romance and heroism, as in his story about meeting Knives Chau on the bus. Knives is on the bus being badgered about boyfriends by her mother, she drops her books, Scott helps her pick them up and tells her, &#8220;Hey&#8230; don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221; Hardly gripping stuff (Scott&#8217;s friends are unimpressed), but the art&#8212;especially the final shot of Scott, filling three quarters of the page, the point of view tilted and slightly below Scott for extra dynamism&#8212;makes the story look exciting.</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://peiratikos.net/wp-content/images/scott-pilgrim-awesome.png" alt="Scott Pilgrim meets Knives" width="400" height="427" /></div>
<h3>&#8220;Scott Pilgrim is dating a high schooler!&#8221;</h3>
<p>Knives Chau is an ideal &#8220;girlfriend&#8221; for Scott. He doesn&#8217;t want sex or even kissing. Knives is still deep in the teenage world of ridiculous complex webs of (quasi)romantic relationships in yearbook class become epics of love and betrayal. She totally buys Scott&#8217;s rock-hero image&#8212;the first time she hears his band play, her eyes acquire a starry, almost zombielike glassiness of pure adoration. Her infatuation with Scott&#8217;s heroic self-image makes her a threat. Scott loves her because she tells him stories and because she adores him, but that adoration means their relationship is in constant crisis. They hover on the edge of a first kiss, neither falling over or stepping back, and that&#8217;s how Scott likes it&#8212;he certainly doesn&#8217;t seem interested in taking the relationship to the next level. There&#8217;s the danger that Knives will, but it must seem to Scott like a safe danger, since Knives is embarrassed even to hold hands and seems simply to enjoy the attention of an older man. But her obsession with the band looks dangerously like taking it to the next level, which is confirmed when Knives shoves the relationship into physicality.</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://peiratikos.net/wp-content/images/scott-pilgrim-kissing.png" alt="Scott Pilgrim Kissing" width="400" height="315" /></div>
<p>The kiss is complicated by the recent entrance of Ramona Flowers into Scott&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Ramona Flowers is the girl of Scott&#8217;s dreams. She rollerblades through a <a href="http://ssdoo.gsfc.nasa.gov/education/just_for_fun/startrek.html#subspace">subspace highway</a> which takes a route through Scott&#8217;s brain as she delivers packages for <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/">Amazon.ca</a>. Through no fault of his own, as a side effect of subspace travel, he gets totally obsessed with Ramona as she glides through his every dream.</p>
<p>Ramona Flowers is another ideal girlfriend for Scott. Unlike poor Knives, Ramona appeals to Scott&#8217;s sexual appetite as well as his romance. She turns his life into a music video/video game, complete with ridiculous mythic backstory about seven evil ex-boyfriends Scott must defeat to win her. Knives has only her high-school stories and her adoration. Ramona isn&#8217;t as impressed with Scott&#8217;s idiosyncracies, but her appearance in Scott&#8217;s life skyrockets him into his own precious fantasy world.</p>
<h3>He&#8217;s a juke box hero, got stars in his eyes<br />
Yeah a juke box hero, stars in his eyes</h3>
<p>The book starts out looking like slice-of-life, but Scott&#8217;s precious little life overpowers the naturalistic storytelling and replaces it with a narrative inspired by the (post)modern heroic romances of rock stars and video games. Can he get away with that? What are the limits of his romanticism? What&#8217;ll happen with Knives? Will Scott ever face the consequences of his insistence on being the hero of whatever story he finds himself in? Will he end up an evil ex-boyfriend himself?

<p>Rose and I got some fun books from <a href="http://www.halfpricebooks.com/">Half Price Books</a> the other day. They&#8217;re published by <a href="http://www.iconbooks.co.uk/">Icon Books</a>, which publishes &#8220;intelligent non-fiction.&#8221; We purchased <a href="http://www.iconbooks.co.uk/book.cfm?isbn=1-84046-118-7"><cite class="Books">Introducing Derrida</cite></a>, <a href="http://www.iconbooks.co.uk/book.cfm?isbn=1-84046-086-5"><cite class="Books">Introducing Foucault</cite></a>, and <a href="http://www.iconbooks.co.uk/book.cfm?isbn=1-84046-489-5"><cite class="Books">Postmodernism for Beginners</cite></a> (which seems to be the same book as <a href="http://www.iconbooks.co.uk/book.cfm?isbn=1-84046-489-5"><cite class="Books">Introducing Postmodernism</cite></a> listed in Icon&#8217;s catalogue).</p>
<p>(I hesitated to call it the &#8220;same&#8221; book, as I was reminded suddenly of the Philosophy 101 problem of identity and ships. One plank on the deck of a wooden ship is replaced with a new one. Is the ship with a replaced plank the <i>same</i> ship as the pre-replacement ship? How many planks must be removed before the ship becomes a <i>different</i> ship? One plank? All of them? A single splinter of one plank? Does the ship have a constant identity which survives replacements of planks? What about humans, in whose bodies cells constantly die and are replace with new cells? An obvious answer [to me, anyway] is that the ship is both same and different, or neither same or different.)</p>
<p>Not all would call these books comic books, I guess. This excerpt from <a href="http://www.iconbooks.co.uk/book.cfm?isbn=1-84046-069-5"><cite class="Books">Introducing Melanie Klein</cite></a> illustrates what the books look like:</p>
<div class="image-link"><a href="http://www.iconbooks.co.uk/images/inmelkspr.gif"><img src="http://peiratikos.net/wp-content/images/thumb-inmelkspr.png" alt="Introducing Melanie Klein" /></a></div>
<p><cite>Postmodernism for Beginners</cite> <i>usually</i> clearly distinguishes typeset text from comics with handwritten speech balloons, but the two often mix together. <cite>Introducing Derrida</cite> blurs the distinction by setting the speech balloons in type and mixing text and pictures more freely. Are these books comic art, or are they prose illustrated with comic art? What is &#8220;comic art?&#8221;</p>
<p>I know of two well-known and widely used definitions (I&#8217;d like to learn of others if any of you readers know of them): <cite class="People">Will Eisner</cite>&#8217;s &#8220;sequential art&#8221; and <cite class="People">Scott McCloud</cite>&#8217;s elaboration: &#8220;juxtaposed pictorial and other images in deliberate sequence, intended to convey information and/or produce an aesthetic response in the viewer&#8221; (<a href="http://scottmccloud.com/store/books/uc.html"><cite class="Comics">Understanding Comics</cite></a>, p. 9).</p>
<p>In <cite>Understanding Comics</cite>, McCloud takes care to create a definition of comics that doesn&#8217;t encompass written words. Comic art must include pictorial images. That means <cite>Seaguy</cite>&#8212;a sequence of pictorial and other images&#8212;is a comic, but <cite>War and Peace</cite>&#8212;a sequence of non-pictorial images (letters, punctuation, etc.) is not a comic. This blog post is a comic. An illustrated <cite>War and Peace</cite> would be a comic.</p>
<p><cite class="People">Craig Thompson</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Comics">Blankets</cite> is called an &#8220;illustrated novel&#8221; on its cover. Illustrations are used to clarify or explain. In an illustrated text, the illustrations are subordinate to the text (in my experience). In Thompson&#8217;s comic book, his pictures are stronger than his words. The pictures convey powerful meaning, and the words are often pale illustrations of the pictures. Why is <cite>Blankets</cite> called an &#8220;illustrated novel?&#8221; Probably because Thompson, or somebody, thought it sounds better (i.e., most people don&#8217;t associate it immediately with comic books) than &#8220;graphic novel.&#8221; &#8220;Pictorial novel&#8221; is too obvious&#8212;people would realize it&#8217;s still a comic book. But I&#8217;m less interested in why Thompson (or somebody) would want to superficially obfuscate <cite>Blankets</cite>&#8217;s status as a comic book than in why he chose &#8220;illustrated novel&#8221; as the obfuscatory term, whether he considered the connotation of subordination in the word &#8220;illustrated.&#8221; (See also Rose&#8217;s <a href="http://peiratikos.net/archives/2004/02/11/but-comic-book-doesnt-work-for-what-we-do-these-days/">&#8220;But &#8216;comic book&#8217; doesn&#8217;t work for what we do these days.&#8221;</a>)</p>
<p>(&#8221;Novel&#8221; causes as many problems as &#8220;illustrated.&#8221; &#8220;Raina&#8221; is a combination of two of Thompson&#8217;s ex-girlfriends. Thompson neglects to mention in the book that he has a sister as well as a brother. Is <cite>Blankets</cite> autobiography? Autobiographical fiction or fictionalized autobiography? Fiction or nonfiction? Both and neither?)</p>
<p>Should pictorial images dominate in comics? Or should they never be subordinate? Both seem risky additions to the definition of comics. The latter at least would likely lead to the rejection of <cite>Understanding Comics</cite> as a comic.</p>
<p>What is comic art?

<p>Because it&#8217;s easier than writing a substantive post, I&#8217;m going to get infected by a meme. <a href="http://mercurystudio.blogspot.com/2004_08_01_mercurystudio_archive.html#109171929769385025">Quoth <cite class="People">Steve Lieber</cite></a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://mercurystudio.blogspot.com/2004_08_01_mercurystudio_archive.html#109171929769385025"><p>I&#8217;d like to challenge other bloggers to come up with their own list of eleven titles that libraries should shelve. No rules, but participants are encouraged to cite a variety of genres, and you get extra bonus points if you can avoid repeating a publisher. One-line summaries are nice, but not required. And no, they don&#8217;t have to be all-ages books, though all-ages lists are certainly welcome. (Links open in new windows.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Eleven books from eleven publishers makes for an especially arbitrary list. I could list fifty comics that libraries should have, but sticking to the rules does keep the list reasonably short and diverse. The first six are good for readers of all ages, the latter five are probably not OK for younger children but may be enjoyed by intelligent young teenagers. They&#8217;re all good comics for adults to read.</p>

<blockquote><p>Like costumed heroes? Confidentially, we in the comic mag business refer to them as &#8220;long underwear characters&#8221;! And, as you know, they&#8217;rea dime a dozen! But, we think you may find our <b>Spiderman</b> just a bit&#8230; different!</p></blockquote>
<p>I hate it when people mispell &#8220;Spider-Man.&#8221; A lot of people, even superhero comics readers, consistently spell it &#8220;Spiderman.&#8221; Can&#8217;t they remember a simple hyphen?</p>
<p>Apparently <cite class="People">Stan Lee</cite> had trouble with the name as well. I just read Spider-Man&#8217;s debut from <cite class="Comics">Amazing Fantasy</cite> #15 (reprinted in the <cite class="Comics">Marvel Age Classic Origins</cite> collection), and I note that Lee spells the name &#8220;Spider-Man&#8221; twice during the story and &#8220;Spiderman&#8221; ten times.</p>
<p>I also learned that Spider-Man had a show-business career before he devoted his life to Great Responsibility. I knew about his brief pre-superheroic wrestling career, but I had no idea he made television appearances and became &#8220;the sensation of the nation.&#8221;

<h3>The Dark Secret</h3>
<p>Just so you know, blogs are probably not the future of journalism. I don&#8217;t know if anybody actually said that, where <a href="http://www.ninthart.com/display.php?article=897"><cite class="People">Hector Reed</cite></a> heard it, but if somebody did say it then he or she is probably wrong.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the dark secret of blogging: most of us are arrogant enough to think people ought to be told what we think and that people will actually care what we think. This is quite obvious, when you think about it&#8212;why else would we spend so much of our time blogging? Most of us certainly aren&#8217;t getting monetary compensation. We must do it because we want people to read about what we think.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the dark secret of humanity: most of us are arrogant enough to think people ought to be told what we think and that people will actually care what we think. I think that must be why we created sophisticated languages that allow us to communicate complex and abstract ideas. Chimpanzees are happy enough warning each other about the large snake that&#8217;s about to eat them, but early humans wanted to brag about what great Mastadon hunters they were, or to give each other fashion advice, so they invented language. The problem in the past was that most humans didn&#8217;t have access to mass media, so their ability to communicate ideas was limited to the people within shouting distance, or the people whose addresses and telephone numbers they knew. Luckily, the Internet changed that. Today we can publish our thoughts for a potential audience of millions.</p>
<div><hr /></div>
<h3>Democracitization</h3>
<p>One big barrier to getting a web site is cost. It costs a lot of money to register a domain name and rent a web server from a hosting company. (It would cost even more to purchase and run your own web server, of course.) Luckily, there are plenty of businesses willing to provide free web hosting in return for placing advertisements on their clients&#8217; web sites. When people in the mid- to late 1990s decided pictures of their babies and cats were important enough to share with the rest of the world, they got a <a href="http://www.geocities.com/">Geocities</a> web site.</p>
<p>Another big barrier is the technology. The web is extremely easy to use, but people still can&#8217;t figure it out. <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/"><acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym></a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/"><acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym></a>, the common languages of the web, are simple and easy to learn, but many people with web sites consider learning them too great a burden. This laziness led to the invention of WYSIWYG HTML editors, which in the mid- to late 1990s were mostly junk. The vast majority of personal web sites consisted of horribly mangled HTML which produced ugly and illegible pages. The growing dominance of Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer web browser hasn&#8217;t helped. Most web users use Internet Explorer, and many of them don&#8217;t care if their web site doesn&#8217;t work in other web browsers. Some of them don&#8217;t know that browsers other than Internet Explorer exist at all.</p>
<p>Luckily, the tools for helping nontechnical people get over the technical barrier to the web have improved in recent years, to the point that current blogging tools&#8212;<a href="http://blogger.com/">Blogger</a>, <a href="http://movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>&#8212;are capable of generating basically functional and standards-compliant web sites that aren&#8217;t ugly. The legibility and aesthetic quality of personal web sites has improved dramatically since the days of Geocities web sites.</p>
<p>A final barrier is informing people that your web site exists. Putting your thoughts on a web site is fine, but how do you let people know your thoughts are available for their perusal? There are more than 40 million web sites on the Internet&#8212;the web has democratized mass communication so much that it&#8217;s easy for your own little web site to get lost in the crowd. This is certainly the largest barrier to running a successful and popular web site. Luckily, there are solutions. One is pinging. Pinging, in this context, means sending a small packet of information about your recently updated blog to a web server which adds your name to a public list of recently updated blogs. People who want to know what they should be reading look at the list, see your blog on it, and go to your web site. Whenever you update your blog, hundreds or even thousands of people may be notified. There are now dozens of pinging services for blogs. <a href="http://peiratikos.net/">Peiratikos</a> uses a metaservice called <a href="http://pingomatic.com/">Ping-O-Matic</a>, which notifies 14 pinging services every time we update.</p>
<p>The web hasn&#8217;t created a mass-communication democracy yet, but it&#8217;s getting there. Anybody with access to the Internet can create a <a href="http://blogger.com/signup.g">Blogger account</a> and start sharing his or her thoughts with everybody else (at least, everybody else who also has access to the Internet). A lot of people can&#8217;t convince anybody to pay attention to their thoughts, and a lot of people don&#8217;t have any thoughts worth paying attention to. (Unfortunately, too few in the latter group are also in the former group.) But it&#8217;s getting easier all the time to cultivate an audience of hundreds or even thousands for your own little personal web site.</p>

<h3>In Conclusion</h3>
<p>Hector Reeder, in his <a href="http://www.ninthart.com/display.php?article=897">Reeder&#8217;s Digest 4</a> column, seems to find bloggers&#8217; vehement reactions to dismissive critiques both amusing and inexplicable. I think it&#8217;s pretty straightforward, actually. When <cite class="People">Heidi MacDonald</cite> said: </p>
<blockquote><p>I have been reading a lot of blogs lately. And I have to say a lot of them are really dopey. (No names.) Give 1,000 monkeys 1,000 typewriters and eventually they????????ll write an issue of Night Nurse or create a blog. And, except for a very few sites, I realized they can pretty much be safely ignored. When you give everyone a voice, no one can hear everything. (<cite class="Magazines">Comics Buyer&#8217;s Guide</cite> #1591, p. 10)</p></blockquote>
<p>she contradicted one of the basic philosophical points of the web. It&#8217;s supposed to be democratic, not elitist. Yes, we all know that there are a lot of dopey blogs that aren&#8217;t particularly worth reading. But the point Hector seems to miss is that criticisms of Heidi&#8217;s article were motivated not by a belief that &#8220;all writing is of equal interest to read,&#8221; but by a belief in creating equal opportunity for people to communicate with the rest of the world. (Whether this is actually a worthy political issue is another question entirely, of course, as is whether blogs are a good way of pursuing the issue.)</p>
<p>Hector is also amused by bloggers&#8217; supposed insularity. Again, though, this is pretty straightforward. One of the dominant paradigms in blogging is one in which conversational social interaction is emphasized. This involves not only the comments systems commonly found on blogs, but also interblog discussions. Blogs are linked together into a loose conversation-based network using standard HTML hyperlinks as well as technologies designed to support conversational blogging, like <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/">TrackBack</a> and <a href="http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback">Pingback</a>. (Why bloggers choose to use blogs instead of other conversational technologies&#8212;chat rooms, message boards, telephones&#8212;is another question entirely.)</p>
<p>By the way, those interested in the origins of the term &#8220;blogosphere&#8221; may find the <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere">&#8220;Blogosphere&#8221;</a> in <a href="http://wikipedia.com/">Wikipedia</a> enlightening.

<div class="text">
<p>Rose and I were at Target yesterday looking for the Marvel Age <cite class="Comics">Spider-Man&#8217;s Pal, Gus Beezer</cite> book for her brother&#8217;s birthday, which was unfortunately unavailable. We picked up <cite class="Comics">Classic Origins</cite> instead, which reprints the first issues of a bunch of Marvel characters. We also picked up Marvel Age reprints of <cite class="Comics">Ultimate X-Men: The Tomorrow People</cite>, <cite class="Comics">Ultimate Spider-Man: Power and Responsibility</cite>, and <cite class="Comics">Emma Frost: Higher Learning</cite>&#8212;if you&#8217;re going to get comics of questionable quality, you might as well get them cheap.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading <cite class="Comics">Ultimate X-Men</cite>, and it seems to have been expurgated. I&#8217;ve looked at these issues in online previews and flipping through the TPB at the bookstore, and I distinctly remember several scenes which are missing from this printing. The opening scene of Sentinels slaughtering people in L.A. and then stepping on a mutatn and his puppy are gone. The scenes of Storm, Colossus, and Beast being recruited to the X-Men are gone. Wolverine being shot down by Weapon X as he leaves the airport in issue #2 is gone. Wolverine hacking his teammates to pieces in the Danger Room is gone. Enough of the text is left intact that you can tell those last two scenes did happen, but their removal leaves obvious and awkward hiccups in the narrative&#8217;s pacing. (Bumps which are somewhat mitigated by the pacing hiccups which the insufficiently skillful <cite class="People">Mark Millar</cite> created himself.) This expurgation doesn&#8217;t really make the book more &#8216;appropriate&#8217; for children: the most graphic violence has been removed, but it&#8217;s still a very violent story. I&#8217;ve read the first two issues (approximately&#8212;there are no markings to distinguish one issue from the next, so I&#8217;m guessing where the issues end and begin), and I&#8217;ve certainly read nothing that makes me think this story about a team of snotty, sexually charged adolescents violently rescuing the world&#8217;s deadliest assassin from a black ops military operation belongs in the same &#8216;all ages&#8217; line as the Gus Beezer comics. It&#8217;s not that I think kids <em>shouldn&#8217;t</em> be allowed to read stuff like <cite>Ultimate X-Men</cite>. I read <cite class="People">Stephen King</cite> novels when I was eleven years old, but I don&#8217;t think they ought to be sold in the children&#8217;s section of the bookstore.</p>
<p>Besides, doesn&#8217;t Mark Millar hate it when comics publishers censor his work?
