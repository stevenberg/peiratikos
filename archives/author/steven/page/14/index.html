Does a shared universe continuity increase verisimilitude, or does it emphasize textuality with historiography and intertexual references? This question brings to my mind the No-Prize---if you, the reader, are given authority to contribute to the text by 'fixing' continuity 'mistakes' in the letter columns, this must mess with verisimilitude a bit, no?</p>

<p>As you can see, our little linkblog has changed. No more sidebar, now the links are integrated into the blog itself, but formated differently. Links now also have their own permalinks and comments threads. The idea for setting up linkblogging this way comes from <a href="http://photomatt.net/archives/2004/05/19/asides/"><cite class="People">Matt Mullenweg</cite></a>. This is a neat way of doing it, I think, because it&#8217;s more compact and slicker than the sidebar and better integrated into the blog.</p>
<p>You can still see the old links at <code><a href="http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/goto/">http://blog.peiratikos.net/archive/goto/</a></code>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also upgraded to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress 1.2</a>, which has finally been released! As long as we&#8217;re upgrading, we figure we might as well play with the design a bit, so expect quickly changing looks over the next week or so. If you encounter any problems with the site, <a href="mailto:sberg@peiratikos.net">let us know</a>!</p>
<p>Next project, beating the citations archive into shape. When will do that? Ah, who knows.

<p><a href="http://johnnybacardi.blogspot.com/2004_05_01_johnnybacardi_archive.html#108541337480531792"><cite class="People">David Jones</cite></a> (a.k.a. Latin hedonist extraordinaire Johnny Bacardi) on <cite class="People">Quentin Tarantino</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Movies">Kill Bill</cite>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://johnnybacardi.blogspot.com/2004_05_01_johnnybacardi_archive.html#108541337480531792"><p>Tarantino&#8217;s simply making film as collage, passing on the styles he loves- no more, no less. He&#8217;s not really aspiring to ART, even though if it happens during the course of the flick that&#8217;s just fine with him.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most certainly! However, I&#8217;m not so sure the &#8216;artistic&#8217; stuff in <cite>Kill Bill</cite> (the parts that seem to make a &#8216;statement&#8217;) are quite as accidental as David implies. I don&#8217;t think Tarantino is aspiring to art, I think he&#8217;s aspiring to undermine art. Every scene in which B.B. appears is full of critical commentary on the very revenge flicks Tarantino references incessantly. Bill&#8217;s Superman speech is especially perceptive in rejecting exactly the ending which the movie eventually gives us. Superman isn&#8217;t really Clark Kent, can&#8217;t really be Clark Kent, and Beatrix Kiddo can&#8217;t really be Mrs. Tommy Plimpton. Being a Mommy isn&#8217;t enough to get you out of the killing life, as <cite>Kill Bill</cite> so effectively demonstrates in its depiction of the Bride&#8217;s bloody revenge&#8212;revenge motivated by, how ironical, the loss of her child. Of course, you might aruge that Mommyhood <em>does</em> allow the Bride to escape her killing life, and the reason she goes back to it for her gory revenge is that she has lost her child and thus her ability to escape. But Bill&#8217;s argument is that this is a false hope, that maybe Beatrix thinks she can just be a Mommy and a non-assassin civilian, but she&#8217;s (ha ha) kidding herself. Besides, her escape into Mommyhood really was only temporary, and ended abruptly when her past arrived to murder her and her new surrogate family in the church. (Besides, being a Mommy redeems you? If that were really the &#8216;point&#8217; of <cite>Kill Bill</cite>, what a cloying mess of smarminess it would be!) So the movie seems to go out of its way to point out that Beatrix is kidding herself with this Mommy stuff, but then it comes up with the most cynical possible ending, which is that yay, Beatrix gets to be Mommy and live happily with little B.B.! Tarantino seems to say, &#8220;You may think this movie means something, but I&#8217;ve made damn sure it doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which I suppose is part of why I didn&#8217;t get a lot out of <cite>Kill Bill</cite>. I guess I liked it fine, but by the time it&#8217;s over Tarantino seems to have flipped right off the deep end of pomo whatever, and I&#8217;m not so sure I want to follow him. I much enjoy the collage aesthetic (I usually call it a remix or DJ aesthetic), but I prefer the playful expressiveness of, say, <cite class="Movies">Moulin Rouge</cite> to the cynical play of <cite>Kill Bill</cite>.

<p>Oh, and <cite class="People">Rose</cite> and I saw <cite class="Movies">Troy</cite> this weekend. Hector was perfect. <cite class="People">Eric Bana</cite>&#8217;s performance just about makes up for the two horrific bits which I&#8217;ll complain about in a bit. <cite class="People">Saffron Burrows</cite> as Andromache and <cite class="People">Diane Kruger</cite> as Helen were also excellent. I know some people were disappointed by Helen&#8217;s beauty, which they felt might launch at most a few rowboats, but certainly not a thousand ships. I must disagree, and anyway Kruger did a fine job with the part, so I say she passes. Oh, and <cite class="People">Peter O&#8217;Toole</cite> as Priam? Well, we all know Peter O&#8217;Toole is <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0061452/">the greatest man that ever breathed</a>, and he remains so in <cite>Troy</cite>. These four characters are just about the only ones whose complexity in <cite class="Books">The Iliad</cite> survives the cinematic translation. I don&#8217;t think much of the words are translated directly from <cite>The Iliad</cite>, but Hector especially captures all the great subtlety, the heroism and ambivalence about his role as warrior that I fondly remember from reading the book in my Greek class. Achilles, on the other hand, loses all his subtlety and ends up sort of too much of a good guy for a lot of what he does to make sense. (Still, although the motivation isn&#8217;t clear enough, I much enjoyed the scenes of Achilles dragging Hector&#8217;s body back to camp and Priam arriving to beg Achilles to return the body for proper burial.)</p>
<p>Now. I said Eric Bana&#8217;s performance just about makes up for the two horrific bits, and here they are! Just wait till you find out how Oddyseus comes up with the Trojan Horse idea. He sees somebody <cite>carving</cite> a little wooden horse? What the fuck? And then there&#8217;s the &#8220;we need to reference <cite class="Books">The Aeneid</cite>&#8221; scene, which goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Paris</b>: &#8220;Aeneas, you must go do the stuff in <cite>The Aeneid</cite>, except instead of carrying around your little statues of household gods, take the Sword of Troy, which is easier to explain to the audience.&#8221;<br />
<b>Aeneas</b>: &#8220;I will, sir!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Paris&#8217;s dialogue is slightly paraphrased there, but Aeneas&#8217;s is word for awful word, directly from the movie. Ack!</p>
<p>The good parts are as good as it gets in swords &#8216;n&#8217; sandals epic cinema. The bad parts are hilariously egregious in their badness. That&#8217;s pretty much what you should expect from a good epic, I think. Actually, a good epic should be four hours long and have an overture, intermission, and entr&#8217;acte, but I suppose I have to accept modern Hollywood&#8217;s commercial necessecities w/r/t very long movies, alas.

<p>I got myself a college degree! Go me. I was getting really burnt out this semester and devoted what little energy I had to my schoolwork, which resulted in a serious reduction in blogging. But now I&#8217;m free, and I just read <cite class="People">Grant Morrison&#8217;s</cite> <cite class="Comics">Seaguy</cite> #1 and <cite class="Comics">New X-Men: Here Comes Tomorrow</cite>, which may very well be my favorite of the <cite>New X-Men</cite> <acronym title="trade paperback">TPB</acronym>s. (I should also give a &#8217;shout out,&#8217; as the cool kids probably don&#8217;t say anymore, to <cite class="People">Cameron Stewart</cite> and <cite class="People">Marc Silvestri</cite>, who bring lovely visual life to Morrison&#8217;s scripts.) I&#8217;m feeling inspired to get back to blogging!</p>
<p>Speaking of Morrison&#8217;s collaboration with Stewart and Silvestri&#8230; <a href="http://ynot.motime.com/1085255528#279513"><cite class="People">David Fiore</cite> has harsh words for those who idealize writer/artists</a>! Consider: if we accept only writer/artists, you know what that means&#8212;no <cite>Seaguy</cite> as the wonderful result of the collaboration of Morrison and Stewart, colorist <cite class="People">Peter Doherty</cite> and letterer <cite class="People">Todd Klein</cite>. And a world without <cite>Seaguy</cite> is not a world <em>I</em> want to live in.
