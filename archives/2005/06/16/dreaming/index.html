<div class="text">
<p>I&#8217;m still on the injured list, with my right arm sort of swollen and sore from today&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCV">NCV</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography">EMG</a>, but when I couldn&#8217;t sleep last night I read <cite class="Comics">Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</cite>, the second volume in <cite class="People">Bryan Lee O&#8217;Malley</cite>&#8217;s <cite class="Comics">Scott Pilgrim</cite> series and because this was a gift from the author, I feel compelled to write something lousy about a fun book in hopes that I&#8217;ll feel more inclined to say something fun later. I read it twice and noticed all sorts of interesting connections on my second time through, so I&#8217;m hoping I&#8217;ll have a second post about some of those later this week.</p>
<p>And this is indeed a fun book. It picks up with the craziness from the end of <cite class="Comics">Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s Precious Little Life</cite> and just gets crazier. Ramona can still show up in Scott&#8217;s dreams (and seriously, that would be the end of the relationship for me; I&#8217;m surprised I can comfortably share an apartment with <cite class="People">Steven</cite>, but he manages to get around my privacy barriers) and there are other dreamers too and more video-game action, not to mention melodramatic coincidences and moments of realization. We get some background on Scott&#8217;s high school days, a secret origin of sorts. And when I talked last year about <a href="../../../../2004/08/22/rating-awesome/index.html">how the first volume made me regain some faith in comics</a>, this year and this volume have brought me back to and beyond superheroes. I know I&#8217;ve argued before that even <a href="../../../../2004/02/04/joan-of-arcadia-alternative-superhero/index.html"><cite class="Television">Joan of Arcadia</cite> is a story about superheroes</a>, and I&#8217;m realizing that I defended superhero comics in the past for things they could do well, but I appreciate those things even more when they&#8217;re done without spandex or breast implants.  And that&#8217;s just what&#8217;s going on in Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s life, from fighting to costume and hairstyle changes to interpersonal drama, superhero stuff. </p>
<p>The reason I like superhero stories is because they have so little to do with the smashing and stomping that are supposed to be at their core, at least if done correctly. Instead they&#8217;re a heavy template for readers to fit themselves into a reality where certain narratives make sense and the readers can make sense of themselves. It&#8217;s not about the power fantasy but about both power and fantasy, which is something over-specific &#8220;slice of life&#8221; stories can miss.  In slicing skewed lives from a slightly off reality, <cite>Scott Pilgrim</cite> manages to avoid being a dullsville story about an endearingly scatter-brained slacker who can&#8217;t bother to get a job or commit to a real and healthy relationship by instead being a story that blows up the drama of the mundane so that it looks the way it feels. Scott&#8217;s heartbroken ex-girlfriend Knives Chau (17 years old!) doesn&#8217;t just get a new look to feel better about herself post-breakup but makes herself an obsessed avenging angel able to play out the fantasies many feel after a first rejection. Sitting on a rug eating garlic bread is a t????te-????-t????te dinner more romantic than a more traditional setup. Casual contact from a lost love can leave even a hero decimated. Romantic mistakes characters make play out in their lives again and again like the returns of villains who in a more standard superhero story would be burly guys or femmes fatales rather than plain old bad habits and bad choices and things going around and coming around. </p>
<p>And honestly I was a tiny bit worried about what direction this book would take, although I expected the humor and the lovely art. I don&#8217;t like stalker romances; they&#8217;re creepy in general and hit too close to home. And yet Scott&#8217;s relationship with Ramona is able to blossom into something real because the world around it, the league of evil ex-boyfriends, is so unrealistic that &#8220;normal&#8221; reactions or behaviors don&#8217;t enter into it at all and none of this bothers me. It&#8217;s the romantic version of cartoon violence, although the pain is palpable (and so is the thrill). But love is scarily full of possibilities, and I did basically love <cite>Scott Pilgrim&#8217;s Precious Little Life</cite>. But I enjoyed its successor, too, and I remain charmed and excited. Last night I would have told you that I still prefer the first book, the mixture of inanity and wackiness, but tonight I was leaning toward the second. It may just be that I can&#8217;t really choose or separate them.  And maybe on a larger scale separation just isn&#8217;t the point. Dreams and video games and real life are hopelessly muddled in this tale, as big bosses steal girls and vanquished foes leave only coins behind them.  One thing flows into another, and while there&#8217;s some game physics going on, it&#8217;s not really clear if this is dream logic or life logic underlying the emotional narrative. I&#8217;m certainly still a fan, a Scottaholic as my little pal Knives would say, and If I can&#8217;t sleep tonight I&#8217;ll be reading again (though really I&#8217;d rather be dreaming myself).
